SLIDE 1

1a. What is Intelligence?
ans: the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations 
     or 
     the skilled use of reason the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or 
     to think abstractly as measured by objective criteria (such as tests)

b. What is Artificial Intelligence?
ans: Systems that think like humans?
     Systems that act like humans?
     Systems that think rationally?
     Systems that act rationally?

c. "The exciting new effort to make computers think...machines with minds, in the full and literal sense"
   who said this and when?
ans: (Haugeland, 1985)

d. "[The automation of] activities that we associate with human thinking, activities such as decision-making, 
   problem solving, learning...” who said this and when?
ans: (Bellman, 1978)

Turing Test
e. Who designed the Turing Test and in what year?
ans: Alan Turing in 1950

f. What is a Turing Test?
ans: it's a test performed to determine a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior

g. Explain how this test works?
ans: The basic concept behind the test is that if a human judge is engaged in a natural language conversation 
     with a computer where he cannot reliably distinguish machine from human, the machine passes the test

     Note that the Responses from both participants in the conversation are received in the form of a 
     text-only channel.

     During the Turing test, the human questioner asks a series of questions to both respondents. After the 
     specified time, the questioner tries to decide which terminal is operated by the human respondent and which terminal is operated by the computer

h. Draw the Turing test diagram
ans: Slide 1 (page 10)

i. Are the below statements true about the Turing Test? 
- The Turing test is used to measure a machine's ability to think and it's an important concept in the
  philosophy of artificial intelligence
- A machine’s success at thinking can be quantified by the likelihood that a human will misidentify it 
  as a human subject.

ans: Yes they are true

Turing Test (Imitation Game)
j. A  computer's ability to think can also be determined through an imitation game. true or false?
ans: true

k. Explain the Imitation Game?
ans: In this game, there are three players A, B and C. Player A is a man, B a woman and C is of either sex. 
     C cannot see A and B, and communicates with the others through written notes.

     Player C determines which of the others is a man and which is a woman by asking a series of questions. 
     Player A tricks the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while B attempts to guide C toward 
     the right path. 

l. Draw a diagram of the Imitation Game?
ans: Slide 1 (page 14)

m. Explain how the original Imitation game test was?
ans: In the original imitation game test, Turing proposes A to be a computer. The computer pretends to be a 
     woman and tricks the interrogator into making an incorrect evaluation. The machine's success is 
     determined by comparing the outcome of the game when A is a computer against when A is a man. If the 
     interrogator goes wrong when playing the game between man and woman, the computer is assessed to be intelligent

Note: 
There are some variations on the interpretation of how a Turing test should be performed but the basic 
premise is whether a human judge can determine whether he is talking to a machine or another human.

SLIDE 2

2a. Artificial intelligence centered automation enables voice technology, like Siri, 
    Cortana, Alexa and Google’s Assistant, to deduce what you actually mean, regardless of the 
    way you express it or your intonation. true or false
ans: true

b. This technology is being improve everyday into more languages on the part of the humans and 
   taking into account wider ranges of intonations
ans: true

c. What is NLU (Natural Language Understanding)?
ans: it's the comprehension by computers of the structure and meaning of human language 
     (e.g., English, Spanish, Japanese, hausa), allowing users to interact with the computer 
     using natural sentences”.
     or
     In other words, NLU is Artificial Intelligence that uses computer software to interpret text and any type of unstructured data

d. NLU can digest a text, translate it into computer language and produce an output in a language that 
   humans can understand.
ans: true

NLU vs NLP
e. NLU and natural language processing (NLP) are often confused
ans: true (they are different parts of the same process of natural language elaboration)

f. NLU is a component of ____?
ans: NLP (natural language processing)

g. More precisely, NLU is a subset of the __________________________
ans: understanding and comprehension part of NLP (natural language processing)

h. Draw the NLU vs NLP vs ASR diagram?
ans: Slide 1 (page 16)

i. NLU interprets the meaning that the user communicates and classifies it into proper intents.
ans: true

j. NLU is responsible for the task of distinguishing what is meant by applying a range of processes such as 
ans: - text categorization, 
     - content analysis and 
     - sentiment analysis, which enables the machine to handle different inputs.

k. What is Natural Language Processing (NLU)?
ans: it is an umbrella term to explain the whole process of turning unstructured data into structured data

l. NLP helps technology to engage in communication using natural human language. As a result, we now have 
   the opportunity to establish a conversation with virtual technology in order to accomplish tasks and answer 
   questions.
ans: true

m. NLU began on the year ________?
ans: 1950

n. Linguist began on the year ________?
ans: 1970-80s

o. Linguistics experts started to contribute to NLU, by ___________ all grammar and semantic rules.
ans: “coding”

p. What happened during 1990 - 2015?
ans: Statistical revolution in Natural Language Processing
       The majority of the models in NLP now include what is called today “Machine Learning”. It is a 
       probability model. The more you give data, the more efficient the model is.

SLIDE 3

3a. Computers are great at working with structured data like ___________________>
ans: spreadsheets and database tables

b. But on the other hand humans usually communicate in words (unstructured data), not in tables. true or false?
ans: true

c. A lot of information in the world is ___________________ 
ans: unstructured (e.g Raw text in English or another human language)

c. NLP is a sub-field of __?
ans: AI

d. NLP is focused on enabling computers to understand and process human languages. true or false?
ans: true

Note: We will discuss how NLP works and learn how to write programs using Python that can extract information 
out of raw text and unstructured data

e. Is it possible for computers to grab human-language?
ans: Yes, but not like humans

f. NLP are easily accessible through open source Python Libraries. Such as
ans: spaCy,
     textacy,
     neuralcoref and more

g. Doing anything complicated in machine learning usually means building a _________?
ans: pipeline (The idea is to break up your problem into very small pieces 
     and then use machine learning to solve each smaller piece separately.)

h. How does the pipeline work?
ans: The idea is to break up your problem into very small pieces and then 
     use machine learning to solve each smaller piece separately. Then by 
     chaining together several machine learning models that feeds into each 
     other, you can do very complicated things.

     And that’s exactly the strategy we are going to use for NLP. We’ll break down the process of understanding English into small chunks and see how each one works.

e. - Considering who is going to be using it, how they are going to be used

g. 4 Activities of Interaction Design
   1. Discovering requirements for an interactive product
   2. Designing alternatives that meet those requirements
   3. Prototyping the alternative designs so that they can be communicated 
      and assessed
   4. Evaluating the product and the UX it offers throughout the process

k. - Are there problems with an existing product?
   - If so what are they

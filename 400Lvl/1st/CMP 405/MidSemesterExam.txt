1. In your own word, distinguish between computer graphics and graphic design
ans: 
     Computer Graphics involves creating, manipulating, and displaying visual content using computers. It focuses on the generation of images, animations, and visual representations of data. It includes areas such as rendering, animation, modeling, and simulation

     Graphic design, on the other hand, is a subset of visual communication that involves creating visual content for various purposes, such as branding, advertising, and user interface design. Graphic designers use computer graphics tools to create designs that communicate specific messages or evoke certain emotions.

2. Describe in detail how the Infrared touch panel works
ans: An Infrared touch panel works by using an array of infrared LED lights 
     and photodetectors placed around the edges of a display. The LEDs emit 
     infrared light across the surface of the display in a grid pattern. When 
     a user touches the screen, their finger or stylus interrupts the infrared 
     light beams, which are then detected by the photodetectors. The touch 
     panel uses this information to determine the location of the touch. By 
     analyzing which beams are interrupted, the system can calculate the 
     precise coordinates of the touch point. This technology allows for accurate and responsive touch input on the screen

3. Write a short note on picture elements highlighting their properties and 
   how it impacts screen resolution
ans: They are the smallest addressable screen element. They are 
     arranged in a grid pattern and are illuminated to create images on a 
     screen. Pixels have properties such as color (or grayscale intensity), 
     brightness, and position. The number of pixels in a display, along with 
     their properties, determines the screen resolution. Higher resolutions 
     have more pixels, which can result in sharper and more detailed images. 
     Screen resolution impacts the clarity and quality of displayed content, 
     with higher resolutions generally providing better visual fidelity.

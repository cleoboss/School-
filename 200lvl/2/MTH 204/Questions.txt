VECTOR SPACES
1. What is a Vector Space?
Ans: Let V be a non-empty set with 2 major operations under an operation called Addition an an operation called Multiplication

b The V is called a vector space over the real field ___?
Ans: K

c. What are Axioms?
Ans: This checks to see if the elements satisfy the rules of being a Vector Space

e. What are the 2 types of Axioms?
Ans: Axiom of Addition
     Axiom of Multiplication

f. Is 0 an element of every set/vector space?
Ans: True

g. What are the 3 Axioms of Addition?
Ans: (u+v)+w = u+(v+w)
     (There Exist) 0 (as an element of) V      - such that 0 + u = u + 0 = u
     (There Exist) -u (as an element of) V     - such that u + (-u) = (-u) + u = 0

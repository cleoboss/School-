1a. A compiler is a program or software that can read a program in one language and translate it into it's equivalent in another language

b. is to report any errors it finds in the source program during translation

c. done

d. Lexical Analysis
   Syntax Analysis
   Semantics Analysis
   Intermediate Code Generation
   Code Optimization
   Target Code Generation

f. Lexical Analysis

g. The Lexical analyzer reads the stream of characters in the source program and groups them into meaningful sequences called lexemes

h. <token-name, attribute-value>

h1. the lexical analyzer would pass the token it generates for each lexeme on to the next compiler phase

h2. its an abstract symbol used during syntax analysis

h3. attribute-value points to an entry in the symbol table

i. info from the Symbol Table is needed for semantics analysis and code generation

j. done

k. Syntax analysis phase (or parsing)

l. Syntax analyzer uses the first components of the token (token-name) to create a tree-like intermediate representation of the grammatical structure of the token stream

m. done

n. The Semantic Analyzer use the Syntax Tree & and info from the Symbol Table to check the source program for semantic consistency in the language definition

o. Symbol Table, or the Syntax Tree

p. done

q. done

r. done

s. done

t. done 

u. done

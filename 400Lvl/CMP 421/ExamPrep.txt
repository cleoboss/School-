DISTRIBUTED OPERATING SYSTEMS

f. What is a Distributed Operating System?
ans: it's an operating system that runs on several machines whose purpose is to provide a 
     useful set of services, generally to make the collection of machines behave more like 
     a single machine

i. What is a Networking Operating System?
ans: it is an operating system designed for the sole purpose of supporting workstations, 
     database, sharing, application sharing and file and printer access sharing among 
     multiple computers in a network

j. List some of the challenges in building Distributed Operating Systems
ans: - Designing a distributed operating system is more difficult than designing a 
       centralised operating system.
     - It is assumed that the operating system has access to complete and accurate 
       information about the environment in which it is functioning. However, a 
       distributed operating system must be designed with the assumption that complete 
       information about the system environment will never be available.
     - In a distributed system, the resources are physically separated, there is no 
       common clock among the multiple processors, delivery of messages is delayed, 
       messages could even be lost.
     - Due to the above reasons, a distributed operating system does not have up-to-date 
       consistent knowledge about the state of the various components of the underlying 
       distributed system.
     - Despite these complexities and difficulties, a distributed operating system must 
       be designed to provide all the advantages of distributed system to its user. That 
       is the users should be able to virtue centralised system that is flexible, 
       efficient, secure and easy to use.




TRANSPARENCY


k. Transparency is an important characteristic of distributed systems, why is this?
ans: Because it makes their operation in the eyes of the user to be more friendly, easy 
     or simple transparent

l. Users should be unaware of the complexities and the location of the services, and 
   the transfer from a local to a remote machine should remain transparent to them
ans: true

m. What is Transparency?
ans: it is the concealment from the user and the application programmer of the separation 
     of components such that it is perceived as a single programmers rather than a 
     collection of autonomous systems which are cooperating

n. List the 8 types of transparencies in a Distributed System?
ans: - Access, 
     - Location migration, 
     - Relocation, 
     - Replication, 
     - Concurrency, 
     - Failure and 
     - Persistence Transparency

o. List some of the issues of Transparency when designing a Distributed System?
ans: - Access transparency enables users to be unaware of the distribution of files. 
       The files could be present on a totally different set of servers which are 
       physically distant apart and a single set of operations should be provided to 
       access these remote files.
     - Location transparency enables sources to be accessed without knowledge their 
       physical or remote location.
     - Failure transparency enables the concealment of faults, allowing users and 
       application programs to complete their task despite the failure of hardware 
       or software components.
     - Concurrency transparency enables several processes to operate concurrently using 
       shared resources without interference between them
     - Scaling transparency enables a system to grow without affecting application 
       algorithm. Note graceful growth and evolution is an important requirement for 
       most enterprises.
     - Performance transparency enables systems to be reconfigured to improve the 
       performance if the need arises.
     - Migration transparency enables the users to be unaware of the movement of 
       information of processes within a system without affecting the operations of the 
       users and the applications hat are running.






REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL (RPC)

6a. What is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC)?
ans: is an inter process communication technique that is used for client-server based 
     application.

b. RPC is also known as __________ or __________?
ans: subroutine call function call

c. How does RPC work?
ans: When a client has a request message, the RPC translates it and sends to the server. 
   The request may be a procedure (or a function) call to the remote server
   The server receives the request, processes the request, and sends the required response 
   back to the client.
   The client is blocked while the server is processing the call and only resumes 
   execution after the server is finished.

d. Draw a diagram of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)?
ans: Slide (page 45)

e. List the sequence of events in a RPC?
ans: - The client stub is called by the client 
     - The client stub makes a system call to  send the message to the server and puts 
       the parameters in the message
     - The message is sent from the client to the server by the clients operating system
     - The message is passed to the server stub by the servers operating system
     - The parameters are removed from the message by the server stub
     - The server procedure is called by the server stub

f. Draw a diagram of the Events of RPC?
ans: Slide (page 47)

g. List the advantages of RPC?
ans: - RPC supports process oriented and thread oriented models
     - The internal message passing mechanism of RPC is hidden from the user
     - The effort to rewrite and redevelop the code is minimum in RPC
     - Many of the protocol layers are omitted by RPC to improve performance

     - Cheaper to build than multiprocessor systems

l. List the disadvantages of DSM?
ans: - Programmers need to understand consistency models
     - By yielding control to DSM manager software, programmers cannot use their own 
       msg-passing solutions

m. What is synchronization?

     provide is made to be identical

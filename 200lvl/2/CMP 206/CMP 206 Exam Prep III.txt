PHYSICAL LAYER

3a. Discuss the Physical Layer?
 Ans: The physical layer defines all the hardware equipments, wiring, cables, frequencies, pulses used for binary signals
      The physical layer interfaces between the hardware and the signalling mechanism
      The physical layer is the only OSI layer that handles conectivity for all connected devices
      The physical layer takes frames from the data link layer and converts it to electrical pulses

 b. What is a signal?
 Ans: A signal is an elecrical impulse that moves through a wire in the form of a voltage

 b1. Main difference between data signal and analogue signals
 Ans: Digital Signals are discrete in nature and represented in a sequence of voltage impulses
      Analog Signals are in continuous waveform in nature and are represented by continuous magnetic waves

 c. Discuss analog and digital data?
 Ans: Data transferred to a user can be analog such as human voice or digital such as a file on a computer
      Digital and Analog data are represented in digital or analog signals

 
 d. When signal travels through a medium it tends to deteriorate. Discuss?
 Ans: This is happens due to the following:
      - Attenuation: when a data travels through a medium it needs to be sufficiently strong since it grows weaker. If it covers a long distance it losses its strength
      - Dispersion: As signals travel through a medium it tends to spread, this depends on the frequency being used
      - Delay Distortion: Signals are sent on a medium with predefined speed and frequency, if the speed and frequency do not match the signals speed and frequency could reach destination in an arbitrary fashion
      - Noise: noise is a random disturbance or fluctuation in an analog or digital signal

 e. What is Noise and the characteristics of Noise?
 Ans: Noise is a random disturbance or fluctuation in an analog or digital signal
      Characteristics
      - Thermal Noise: when heat develops in the medium it agitates the electronic conductor and introduces noise
      - Intermodulation: This happens when multiple frequencies share a medium, there interferences introduces noise
      - crosstalk: This occurs when a foreign signal enters the media, signal in one media affects signal in the other causing noise
      - impulse: This occurs due to lightening, electricity, short-circuit, fauty components.
 
 f. What is Transmission Media?
 Ans: The physical media used to share information between two connected devices

 g. What are the 2 forms of transmission media?
 Ans: Guided Media: In the guided media the devices are directly connected and the information is sent via the media
      Unguided Media: In ungided media the devices are not directly connected and the information is spread over the air, anyone can recieve it including the recipient

 h. What are the different types of transmission media?
 Ans: Magnetic Media:
          This is an old fashion media that stores data physically in the media and is used to transport data physically from one station to the other in the media
          It is used to backup data in buisness communities
          It also helps save companies huge amount of moneys

      Twisted Pair Cable:
          This is made up of two plastic insulated copper wires twisted together to form a single media
          One of the two wires carries the actual current while the latter is used for ground reference
          The twist helps reduce noise

          There are two(2) types of twisted pair cables
          - shielded and unshielded

      Coaxial Cable
          Coaxial cables are made up of two copper wires
          The core wire lies in the center and is a solid conductor
          The core wire is enclosed by an insulating sheath
          The second wire is wrapped around the insulating sheath and is encased by it's own insulating sheath
          Then all of these are then covered by a plastic cover
          Due to the strength of Coaxial cables, it is capable of carrying high frequencies more than a twisted pair cable
      Power Line Communication(PLC)
          PLC is a layer-1 technology and it uses power cables to transmit data
          In PLC, modulated data is sent through the cables
          The reciever on the other end gets and demodulates the data in order to interpret it
          All powered devices can be controlled and monitored
          PLC works in half duplex

          There are two(2) types of PLC
          - Narrow band: lowers data rates up to 100s of Kbps
          - Broad band: increases data rates up to 100s of Mbps

      Fiber optic Cable
          The fiber optic works on the propertise of light
          when light ray hits a critical angle it tends to refract at 90 degrees
          This propertise is what fiber optics employ
          light is emitted on one end and it travels through the media and is then detected on the other end by a light detector
          The light detector detects the light stream and converts it to electrical data

          fiber optics comes in two(2) modes:
          - single mode: uses a single ray of light
          - multi mode: uses multiple beams of light
          
 h1. What are the following cables connected with: Unshielded twisted pair cable, Coaxial cable, fiber optics?
 Ans: UTP: cables are connected with RJ45
      Coaxial cables: are connected with BNC and BNC-T connector

 h2. What are the categories for the following cables: Unshielded twisted pair cable, Coaxial cable?
 Ans: UTP: Cat-5, Cat-5e, Cat-6 and are used to render high speed internet

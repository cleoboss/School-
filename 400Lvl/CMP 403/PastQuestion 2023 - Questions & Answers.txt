Past Questions
1a. What is evolution?
ans: It is the gradual development of something

i. What is the difference between Software evolution and Software maintenance?
ans: 
  Software Evolution:
  - Refers to the ongoing improvement and enhancement of software.
  - Includes adding new features, improving performance, fixing bugs, and enhancing architecture.
  - Responds to changing user needs, technology, market trends, or organizational requirements.
  - Involves iterative updates or versions to add functionality or enhance existing features.
  - Aims to keep software relevant, efficient, and effective for users over time.

  Software Maintenance:
  - Ongoing management of software post-deployment.
  - Includes bug fixing, security patching, performance optimization, and ensuring compatibility.
  - Types: Corrective (bug fixing), Adaptive (adapting to new environments), Perfective (improving performance), Preventive (addressing potential issues).
  - Reactive nature compared to proactive software evolution.
  - Can dominate software lifecycle for long-lived or critical systems.

b. List and explain different types of testing done during the testing phase
ans: 1. Unit Testing: Testing individual units or components of the 
        software in isolation.
     2. Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between integrated 
        units/modules.
     3. System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it 
        meets specified requirements.
     4. Acceptance Testing: Testing performed to determine whether the 
        system meets user/customer requirements.
     5. Regression Testing: Testing to ensure that previously developed and 
        tested software still performs after a change.
     6. Performance Testing: Testing to assess the performance 
        characteristics of the system under various conditions.
     7. Load Testing: Testing to evaluate system performance under 
        anticipated load conditions.
     8. Stress Testing: Testing to evaluate system behavior under extreme 
        conditions beyond normal operation.
     9. Usability Testing: Testing to assess how user-friendly and 
        intuitive the software is.
     10. Security Testing: Testing to identify vulnerabilities and ensure 
        the security of the software.

c. What is User Acceptance Testing? 
ans: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final phase of testing before 
     releasing a software product to the end-users. It involves validating 
     that the system meets the business requirements and functions 
     correctly from the user's perspective. UAT is typically conducted by 
     the end-users or stakeholders who will ultimately use the software in 
     real-world scenarios.

c1. Explain different testing in user acceptance testing. 
ans: - Alpha Testing: This type of testing is performed by a select group 
       of end-users or stakeholders within the organization, usually in a 
       controlled environment. It aims to uncover any issues or defects 
       before the software is released for beta testing or to a wider 
       audience.

     - Beta Testing: Beta testing involves releasing the software to a 
       limited number of external users or customers for testing in a 
       real-world environment. Feedback from beta testers is collected to 
       identify any remaining issues or usability concerns before the final 
       release.

     - Contract Acceptance Testing: In this type of testing, the software 
       is tested against the contract or agreement between the client and 
       the vendor. It ensures that all agreed-upon requirements and 
       functionalities have been implemented correctly.  

c2. Why is it necessary?
ans: - Validation of Requirements: UAT ensures that the software meets the 
       specified business requirements and performs as expected in 
       real-world scenarios.

     - Quality Assurance: It helps identify any defects or issues that may 
       have been overlooked during earlier testing phases, ensuring a 
       higher level of quality before the software is released.

     - User Satisfaction: UAT allows end-users or stakeholders to provide 
       feedback on the software's usability, functionality, and overall 
       user experience, leading to higher user satisfaction.

     - Risk Mitigation: By identifying and addressing any remaining issues 
       or concerns before release, UAT helps mitigate the risk of software 
       failure or dissatisfaction among users.

     - Compliance: UAT ensures that the software complies with relevant 
       regulatory standards and contractual agreements, reducing the risk 
       of non-compliance and potential legal issues.

ans: wired, wireless

e. The Effectiveness of data communication system depends on 3 fundamental 
   characteristics. Name them
ans: - Delivery
     - Accuracy
     - Timeliness

e1. Explain all 3
ans: - Delivery: The system must deliver data to the correct destination
     - Accuracy: The system must deliver data accurately
     - Timeliness: The system must deliver data in a timely manner.

f. List 8 Standards Organization for Data Communication?

     - International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Sector (ITU-T)
     - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
     - American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
     - Electronics Industry Association (EIA)
     - Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
     - Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
     - Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
     - Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)

g. List and explain the 5 major Data Communication components?
ans: - Transmitter: is the device that sends the message, it can be a 
       computer, workstations, telephone e.t.c
     - Receiver: Is the device that receives the message. It can be a 
       computer, workstation telephone e.t.c
     - Medium: is the physical path by which a message travels from the 
       sender to receiver through pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic 
       cable, radio waves etc
     - Message: is the transmission (data) to be communicated. It can 
       consist of text, number, picture, sound, video. etc
     - Protocol: is a set of rules that governs data communication. It 
       represents an agreement between the communicating devices. Without 
       a protocol, two device may be connected but not communicating.

h. What is Data Communication Circuits?
ans: Data communication circuit provides a transmission path between 
     locations and transfers digital information from one station 
     (node, where computers or other digital equipment are located) to 
     another using electronic circuits

h1. Draw a diagram of Data Communication Circuits?
ans: Slide 1 (page 169)

h2. Discuss what takes place on each step in the above diagram?
ans: - Source: This device generates the data to be transmitted; examples 
       are mainframe computer, personal computer, workstation Mobile 
       Station etc. The source equipment provides a means for humans to 
       enter data into system.
     - Transmitter: A transmitter transforms and encodes the information 
       in such a way as to produce electromagnetic signals that can be 
       transmitted across some sort of transmission system. For example, a 
       modem takes a digital bit stream from an attached device such as a 
       personal computer and transforms that bit stream into an analog 
       signal that can be handled by the telephone network.
     - Transmission medium: The transmission medium carries the 
       electromagnetic signals from the transmitter to the receiver. 
       Different types of transmission media include free-space radio 
       transmission (wireless transmission) and physical facilities such as 
       metallic and optical fiber cables. 
     - Receiver: The receiver accepts the signal from the transmission 
       medium and converts it into a form that can be handled by the 
       destination device. For example, a modem will accept an analog 
       signal coming from a network or transmission line and convert it 
       into a digital bit stream.
     - Destination: Takes the incoming data from the receiver and can be 
       any kind of digital equipment like the source

i. Transmission mediums are also known as _______?
ans: Channels

j. What is the capacity of a Channel?
ans: It is the maximum amount of signals or traffic that a channel can 
     carry

j1. How is the capacity of a Channel measured?
ans: it is measured in terms of bandwidth and data transfer rate. Bandwidth 
     is measured in Hertz (1KHz = 1000 Hz)
 
j2. What is the bandwidth of a Channel?
ans: It is the range of frequencies available for transmission of data 
     through that channel

j3. Higher bandwidth equals (=) what?
ans: Higher data rate

j4. Data travels in the form of ____________ over channels?
ans: electromagnetic signals

j5. Data signal carries one or two ____ or ____ bits over the channel.
ans: 1 or 2

j6. What is Data transfer rate?
ans: it is the number of bits transmitted between source and destination in 
     1 second. It is measured in terms of bits per second (bps)

j7. Answer the below
1 Kbps = ?
1 Mbps = ?       
1 Gbps = ?
1 Tbps = ?
ans: 1 Kbps = 1024 bps    
     1 Mbps = 1024 Kbps       
     1 Gbps = 1024 Mbps  
     1 Tbps = 1024 Gbps

j8. What is the formula for calculating Data Transfer Rate speed?
ans: S = A ÷ T
     where:
     S = speed (or rate) of transfer
     A = Amount of data
     T = Time 

j9. Calculation. Determine the speed or the rate of transfer 
    of 25 megabyte(mb) in 2 min.
ans: S = A ÷ T
     where:
     A = 25mb
     T = 2min * 60sec = 120sec
     S = 25mb ÷ 120sec = 0.208mbps
     #Convert mbps to Kbps
     0.208mbps * 1024kbps = 212.9kbps

j10. Calculation. You transferred 100 GB at a rate of 7 MB/s. 
     Compute the Time required for the transfer.
ans: T = A ÷ S
     where:
     T = ?
     A = 100gb
     S = 7mbps
     # convert 100gb to mb
     100gb * 1024mb = 102400mb
     T = 102400mb ÷ 7mbps
       = 14628.6sec
     # convert to hour
     14628.6sec ÷ 60 ÷ 60 = 4.06hours

j11. A user wants to upload a text document at the rate of 
     10 pages per 20 seconds. What will be the required data 
     rate of the  channel ?. Assume that 1 page contains 1600 
     characters and each character is of 8 bits.
ans: S = A ÷ T
     where:
     A = 10pages * 1600 characters * 8bits = 128000bits
     T = 20seconds
     S = 128000bits/20seconds
     S = 6400bps
     # convert to Kbps
       = 6400bps ÷ 1024b
       = 6.25kbps

k. What is the transmission medium?
ans: The transmission medium is the physical path between 
     transmitter and receiver in a data transmission system. 
     It is included in the physical layer of the OSI protocol hierarchy.

l. The Transmission media can be generally categorized as either 
   _______ or _________?
ans: unguided, guided

m. Explain Guided Transmission Media?
ans: Guided Transmission Media uses a "cabling" system (or 
     some sort of conductor) that guides the data signals along 
     a specific path. The data signals are bound by the "cabling" system.  
     The conductor directs the signal propagating down it.

n. Guided Media is also known as __________?
ans: Bound Media

o. List 2 examples of Guided Transmission media?

ans: Unguided Transmission Media is a means for data signals 
     to travel without anything to guide them along a specific path.

r. The data signals in unguided media are not bound to a 
   cabling media and as such are often called _________?
ans: Unbound Media

s. ___________ are wireless systems

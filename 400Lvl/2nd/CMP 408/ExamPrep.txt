     Web attacks - (e.g Phishing, SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting)
     OS, applications and software attacks - (e.g Virus, Trojan, Worms, Rootkits, Buffer Overflow)
     Social Engineering

i. What is a virus?
ans: It's a piece of code that automatically reproduces itself. It‚Äôs attached to other 
     programs or files, but requires user intervention to propagate

j. What is a worm?
ans: It's a piece of code that automatically reproduces itself over the Network. It doesn‚Äôt 
     need user intervention to propagate (autonomous)

k. What is a Backdoor?
ans: A backdoor is a program placed by a black-hacker that allows him to 
     access a system. A backdoor have many functionalities such as 
     keyboard-sniffer, display spying, etc

l. What is a Trojan?
ans: A Trojan is a software that seems useful in the beginning, but is actually 
     hiding a malicious functionality

m. What is RootKits (the ultimate virus)?
ans: Rootkits operate like backdoor and Trojan, but also modify existing 
     programs in the operating system. That allows a black-hacker to control 
     the system without being detected. A rootkit can be in user-mode or in 
     kernel-mode.

n. What is the goal of backdoor, Trojan and rootkits?
ans: The goal of backdoor, Trojan and rootkits is to take possession of a 
     machine subsequently through an infection made via a backdoor

Introduction to Cryptography
















2a. What does the greek word Cryptography mean?
ans: (crypto) - secret
     (graphy) - writing

b. What is Cryptography?
ans: It is the art of mangling information into apparent unintelligibility 
     in a manner allowing a secret method of unmangling
     or
     It‚Äôs the art of creating and using codes to secure transmission of 
     information
     
     Additionally:
     It allows the transformation of a plaintext (cleartext) into a 
     ciphertext and vice versa 
     - Plaintext ü°™ciphertext = encryption 
     - Ciphertext ü°™plaintext = decryption

c. List 4 reasons why Cryptography is needed?
ans: - It Protects stored data 
     - Protects data in transit 
     - Provides protection against 
       - Data eavesdropping and Tampering with data 
     - Could be easily used for authentication purposes

d. What is Cryptanalysis?
ans: It is the art of obtaining original message from ciphertext without 
     access to secret information (key or algorithm itself)

e. What is Cryptology?
ans: It is the combination of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis

f. Discuss "When Did it all start" Cryptography?
ans: 
- Julius Caesar (sometime BC) ! 
  - A substitution cipher 
  - The Caesar cipher replaces the ith letter by the i+3th letter 
    - CAT becomes FDW 
    - Wraps around to A from Z 
- Generalised in monoalphabetic ciphers 
  - No restriction (such as i ü°™i+3) on which letter could be 
    assigned to which 
    - E.g. A is encrypted as B, B as D, C as Z, D as A, etc. 
    - 26! possible monoalphabetic ciphers (4x1026) 
  - Stronger than Julius Caesar, but would you use it? 
    - NO ! Vulnerable to statistical analysis 
  - Most common English letters? 

g. Discuss "What happened next"?
ans: - Vigenere Cipher 
       - Not his 
       - First appeared in Rome in ‚ÄúLa cifra del. Sig. 
         Giovan Battista Bellaso‚Äù, in 1553 
       - ‚ÄúLe chiffre ind√©chiffrable‚Äù for about 3 
          centuries 
       - Similar to a Caesar cipher but has a variable 
         shift value 
         - First letter shifted by 5, second by 17, third by 11 
         - 5, 17 and 11 are defined by a secret 
         - The values range is 0 to 25 (A to Z): A is 0, Z is 25

g1. Encrypt HACKNOW using CAT (With the vigenere Cipher)?
ans: Slide 4 (page 7)

h. Keeping an algorithm secret prevents _______ from knowing it ü°™they 
   cannot break it. This is also known as _________
ans: crackers, Security through obscurity

h. Why should Crypto algorithms be kept secret?
ans: - Keeping an algorithm secret prevents crackers from knowing it ü°™they 
       cannot break it 
       - Security through obscurity 
     - Difficult in practice 
       - Each time you use the algorithm with someone, they need to learn  
         it (and might leak it?) 
       - If it is implemented in some hardware, reverse-engineering it 
         could reveal the algorithm
     - Making an algorithm available makes it possible for crackers to do 
       all tests on the algorithm 
       -  And all the good guys too 
       -  As a good guy finds a loophole, she warns people 
     - Fundamental Tenet of Cryptography 
       - ‚ÄúIf lots of smart people failed to solve a problem, then it 
         probably won't be solved (soon)‚Äù 
     - Nowadays, most of commercial algorithms are public, whereas some 
       military algorithms are kept secret
     - Kirchhoff's principle 
       - A cryptographic algorithm must not be required to be secret, and 
         it must be able to fall into the hands of the enemy without 
         inconvenience 
       - Its key must be communicable and retainable without the help of 
         written notes, and changeable or modifiable at the will of the 
         correspondents 
     - The only secret in the system should be the key 


i. Discuss how difficult it is to find a key?
ans: - Assume you are using an algorithm with a 16 bit key 
       - 216 (=16384) possible keys 
       - If a computer can test 100 keys/sec, then it will take a bit less 
         than 3 minutes to try all of them 
         - brute-force 
       - And, in average, half that time to find the right key 
       - This time doubles for each added bit (0 or 1) 
       - For a 24 bit key, the same computer will need almost 20 months to 
         try all combinations 
     - In practice, computers are much faster, but keys are much longer too 
     - We would say that it is computationally infeasible to brute-force a 
       cryptographic algorithm if it required an unreasonable amount of 
       time using the most powerful computers 
     - Note that if the keys are chosen and used by humans, then they have 
       limited choices 
       - 24 bit key is a 3 character key 
       - Say for example that the used characters are upper and lower case 
         and numerals 
       - 26+26+10 = 62 possibilities for each character 
       - 623(=238328) possible keys in all 
       - Takes less than an hour to try all combinations ! 
     - Nowadays, 280 possible combinations are considered feasible

j. List 3 typical attacks used in breaking Crypto Algorithms?
ans: - Ciphertext only
     - Known Plaintext
     - Chosen Plaintext

j1. Explain each of the attacks?
ans: - Ciphertext only:
       - Attacker has access to encrypted messages 
       - The attacker has to try possible keys in turn until one works 
       - The attacker has to be able to recognize that a key actually works 
         - Hence the name recognizable plaintext attack 
       - Problem when dealing with a cipher text that can be decrypted in 
         several ways 
          - Should have many samples 
          - Does not occur with modern crypto algorithms (too randomised 
            outputs) 

     - Known Plaintext:
       - The attacker obtained pairs of plain and cipher texts 
       - Could be because the meaning of the ciphertext was revealed 
         - Attack? Yes, no 
         - Next target? 
       - Should prevent attackers from getting those pairs 
         - Adding a sequence number 

     - Chosen Plaintext
       - The attacker can choose the plaintext and make the system encrypt 
         it!
       - Real life example: WEP 
         - In WEP, the access point can send random numbers to the station 
         (e.g. laptop) and the station encrypts and returns it 
         - An attacker could pretend to be the access point 
       - Same if there are only few possible meanings of the ciphertext 
         - E.g. YES or NO

h. List 3 types of Crypto (or Cryptographic) Algorithm?
ans: - Secret Key Algorithms
     - Public Key algorithms
     - Hash algorithms

h1. Explain each algorithm above?
ans: - Secret Key Algorithms: 
       - Most intuitive: same key for encryption and decryption 
       - Also known as Symmetric Cryptography 
       - Many uses in secure systems, one of the most obvious ones is 
         confidentiality 
       - The two communication parties have to find a way of sharing the 
         key before communicating 
         - More on this later

     - Public Key algorithms:
       - Keys work in pairs 
       - When a key is used to encrypt, only the other one can decrypt 
       - Can encrypt with either; different uses 
       - Also known as Asymmetric Cryptography 
       - Typically one key is kept secret (private key), the other one is 
         made public (public key) 
       - Many uses in secure systems, one of the most obvious ones is 
         authentication 
       - The two communication parties have to find a way of sharing public 
         key(s?) before communicating 
         - More on this later

     - Hash algorithms:
       - A one-way transformation 
         - If h is a hash function such that y=(h), then it is 
           computationally infeasible for a user who has h and y to find x
           (or an x‚Äô ?such that h(x‚Äô)=y) 
       - Gives a fixed length output, whatever the input size is 
         - MD5‚Äôs is 128, SHA-1‚Äôs is 160 
       - The output is sometimes called hash, digest or checksum 
       - Many uses in secure systems, one of the most common ones is 
         digital signatures 
         - More on this later 











SLIDE 5






Secret Key Cryptography
















3a. List 4 Common uses of Secret Key Cryptography?
ans: - Confidentiality: sender and receiver share a secret and use it 
       to communicate
     - Secure storage: encrypt content before storing it
     - Authentication: share a key and prove that you know it when being 
       authenticated
     - Integrity: instead of having a simple cleartext checksum, encrypt it 
       - Becomes Message Integrity Check or Code

b. Name the 2 techniques used for Secret Key Cryptography?
ans: - Stream ciphers
     - Block ciphers

b1. Explain both techniques above?
ans: - Stream ciphers: can encrypt any size
       - Are based on random number generators
       - The generated random number string has the same size as the data
     - Block ciphers: encrypt fixed size blocks
       - The data to be encrypted is split into blocks of a predefined size
       - If the block is smaller than that size, then padding bits are 
         added before encryption (e.g. add zeros at the end)
       - Example: DES and IDEA use 64 bit blocks, AES uses 128 bit block

c. Discuss Stream Cipher?
ans: - Generates a random string: Keystream
       - Not to be confused with the shared Key
     - XORs it with the message to be encrypted
     - The random string is not really random
       - Pseudo-random
     - The pseudo-random string is used only once
       - One-time pad
     - RC4 is one of the most widely known stream ciphers
       - Used in WEP and in one version of WPA (TKIP)
       - Designed in 1987 and leaked out in 1994
       - Ron‚Äôs (Rivest) Code?
       - Rivest Cipher 4?

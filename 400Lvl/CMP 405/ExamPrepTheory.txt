1a. What is Computer Graphics?
 b. What is a Pixel?
    i. How are pixels controlled?
 c. List 5 advantages of Computer graphics



Answer
1a. Computer Graphics is any sketch, drawing, special artwork or other 
    materials to pictorially depict an object or process or otherwise 
    convey information, as a supplement to or instead of written description

 b. A pixel is the smallest addressable screen elements
    or 
    it is the smallest piece of display screen which we can control

    i. By setting the intensity and color of the pixel
 c. 1. It provides tools for producing pictures not only of concrete  
       real-world object but also of abstract.
    2. It has the ability to show moving pictures and thought it possible 
       to produce animation with computer graphics. 
    3. With it, users can control animation speed, portion of the view and 
       goniometric relationship of the object in the scene to one another 
       and the amount of detail shown.
    4. It provides tools called motion dynamics. Which allows us to move 
       objects, tumble them with respect to stationary observer, or make objects stationary while the viewer moves around them.
    5. It provides a facility called update dynamics. Which allows us 
       change the shape, color and other properties objects.
    6. With the recent development of digital signal processing and audio 
       synthesis chip the interactive graphics can now provide audio 
       feedback along with the graphical feedback to make the simulated 
       environment even more realistic

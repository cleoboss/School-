QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

1a. Assuming you work as a cloud engineer at your company and 
    you manage the data hosted on your company’s server in the night, an attacker was able to access your database and insert some malicious records in your database, so in the morning when you came, you ran your daily data verifications checks and you got an alarm that something has gone wrong, which pillar of CIA has been violated? (Explain your answer) (8 Marks) 
ans: CIA Pillar Violated
     The CIA Triad consists of C-Confidentiality, I-Integrity, and A-Availability. In this scenario, the pillar of Integrity has been violated. 
     
     Integrity ensures that data remains accurate, consistent, and trustworthy over its entire lifecycle. The insertion of malicious records into the database compromises the trustworthiness and accuracy of the data, indicating a breach of integrity.


b. When Bob initiates communication with Alice, a situation 
   arises where Jackson hijacks the transmission and 
   impersonates Alice. Could you illustrate possible event 
   scenarios using a diagram? (8 Marks) 
ans: 
     Bob -----------------> Alice (Intended)
        \                  ^
         \                /
          \              /
           \            /

                \  /
               Jackson (Hijacker)
     1.	Bob sends a message to Alice.
     2.	Jackson intercepts the message.
     3.	Jackson impersonates Alice and sends a 
        fake response to Bob.


c. What are four essential security services that are typically 
   necessary when making a purchase from amazon's e-commerce platform? Provide a justification for each service. (8 Marks) 
ans: Security Services for Amazon E-commerce Platform
     1. Confidentiality: Protects customer data from 
        unauthorized access, ensuring personal and payment 
        information remains private. For example, encryption is 
        used to secure data transmitted between the customer and 
        Amazon.
     2. Integrity: Ensures that data, such as order details and 
        payment information, is accurate and has not been 
        tampered with. This is achieved through the use of 
        checksums and hash functions.
     3. Authentication: Verifies the identity of customers and 
        merchants to prevent fraudulent transactions. Amazon 
        uses multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that 
        users are who they claim to be.
     4. Non-repudiation: Ensures that a party cannot deny the 
        authenticity of their signature on a document or the 
        sending of a message. Digital signatures and audit logs 
        are used to provide proof of transactions.


d. Two business partners engage in a contract negotiation via 
   email. Describe a scenario where one partner later denies 
   agreeing to specific terms, highlighting the need for 
   non-repudiation to resolve the dispute. (6 Marks) 
ans: Scenario: 
     Two business partners, Alice and Bob, engage in contract negotiations via email. Alice agrees to specific terms in an email. Later, Alice denies agreeing to those terms, leading to a dispute.
    
     Non-repudiation is crucial here to prove that Alice did indeed agree to the terms. Using digital signatures ensures that Alice cannot deny sending the email with the agreed terms, as her digital signature provides proof of origin and integrity of the message.




2a. Two branches of a multinational corporation DBASE, need to 
    establish a secure communication channel over an untrusted 
    network. Describe a scenario where the branches must 
    distribute encryption keys securely and explain the 
    challenges they may face during the key distribution 
    process. (8 Marks) 
ans: a. Secure Key Distribution
        Scenario: Two branches of DBASE, located in different countries, need to establish a secure communication channel over an untrusted network.
        Challenges:
        - Key Exchange: Securely exchanging encryption keys over 
          an untrusted network is challenging. They can use 
          Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or Diffie-Hellman key 
          exchange to securely distribute keys.
        - Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: An attacker could intercept 
          the keys during transmission. Using certificates 
          signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) can 
          mitigate this risk.


b. Prove S=X1A2 Mod P = X2A1 Mod P = YA1A2 Mod P (6 Marks)
ans: 


c. A social media platform wants to store user passwords 
   securely. Describe a scenario where the platform utilizes 
   hashing to protect user passwords and explain the advantages 
   of using hashing over other methods of password storage. 
   (6 Marks) 
ans: Hashing Passwords
     Scenario: A social media platform wants to store user passwords securely.
     Advantages of Hashing:
     - One-way Function: Hashing is a one-way function, making 
       it infeasible to reverse-engineer the original password 
       from the hash.
     - Salted Hashing: Adding a unique salt to each password 
       before hashing prevents the use of precomputed hash 
       tables (rainbow tables) for cracking.
     - Security: Even if the hashed passwords are exposed, the 
       original passwords remain protected due to the difficulty 
       of reversing the hash.




3a. As a consultant hired to educate the staff of the Central 
    Bank of Nigeria about the risks of unauthorized access, what 
    key arguments would you present in favor of recommending the 
    inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numerals, and special 
    characters in passwords? Alternatively, would you advise 
    them to use only lowercase characters? Support your 
    explanation with statistical evidence. (7 Marks)
ans: Arguments for using lowercase, uppercase, numerals, and 
     special characters:
     - Increased Entropy: Each additional character type 
       significantly increases the number of possible 
       combinations, making brute-force attacks more difficult.
     - Statistical Evidence: A password with only lowercase 
       letters (26 characters) and length 8 has 26826^8268 
       combinations (~208 billion). Including uppercase, 
       numerals, and special characters (~94 characters) 
       increases this to 94894^8948 combinations (~6 
       quadrillion).
     - Lowercase-only passwords are easier to crack due to fewer 
       possible combinations.


b. Bingham Ventures utilizes an SQL database to store sensitive
   customer information, including personal details and 
   financial data. Describe a scenario where SQL injection 
   occurs, explain the potential consequences of this attack, 
   and suggest preventive measures to mitigate the risk of SQL 
   injection vulnerabilities in the company's database system. 
   (7 Marks) 
ans: Scenario: Bingham Ventures’ SQL database is vulnerable to
     SQL injection.
     
     Potential Consequences:
     - Data Breach: Attackers can access, modify, or delete 
       sensitive customer information.
     - Financial Loss: Exposure of financial data can lead to 
       significant monetary loss.
     
     Preventive Measures:
     - Parameterized Queries: Use prepared statements to 
       separate SQL code from data.
     - Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs 
       to ensure they do not contain malicious SQL code.
     - Least Privilege: Limit database permissions to the 
       minimum necessary for application functionality.


c. A spy agency needs to securely transmit a confidential 
   message to its operative in the field. Describe a scenario 
   where the agency decides to use a Caesar cipher encryption 
   technique to protect the message. Explain how the Caesar 
   cipher works, its limitations, and suggest additional 
   cryptographic methods that could enhance the security of the 
   message transmission. (6 Marks) 
ans: Scenario: A spy agency uses Caesar cipher to encrypt a 
     message.

     How Caesar Cipher Works:
     - Shift: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed 
       number of positions in the alphabet.
     - Example: With a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 
       'E', etc.

     Limitations:
     - Simplicity: Easily broken with frequency analysis or 
       brute-force attacks due to limited key space (26 possible 
       shifts).

     Enhanced Methods:
     - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Provides strong 
       encryption with larger key sizes (128, 192, or 256 bits).
     - Public Key Cryptography: Uses a pair of keys (public and 
       private) for secure communication.


4a. During the establishment of an SSL session, there are four 
    stages that play a crucial role in maintaining a secure link 
    for data transmission between communicating devices. What 
    occurs if the user suspends the connection and attempts to 
    resume data transmission at a later time? Please provide a 
    diagrammatic illustration to support your answer. (8 Marks)
ans: SSL Session Resumption
     If a user suspends the connection and resumes later, the SSL session can be resumed without a full handshake using session tickets or session IDs. Here’s a diagram:
     
Client           Server
  |                |
  |---Hello------->|
  |<---Hello-------|
  |---Key Exchange->|
  |<---Key Exchange-|
  |---Finished----->|
  |<---Finished-----|
(Session Established)

  |                |
  | (Suspend)      |
  | (Resume)       |
  |---Resume------>|
  |<---Resume------|


b. Differentiate between these authentication methods with 
   examples 
   i.   Something I am 
   ii.  Something I posses 
   iii. Something I know (6 Marks) 
ans: 1.	Something I am: Biometric authentication (e.g., 
        fingerprint, facial recognition).
     2.	Something I possess: Token-based authentication (e.g., 
        smart card, security token).
     3.	Something I know: Knowledge-based authentication (e.g., 
        password, PIN).


c. What properties must you consider when working with the RSA 
   parameters n, e and d? (6 Marks) 
ans: Properties to consider:
     - n (Modulus): Product of two large prime numbers (p and q).
     - e (Public Exponent): Typically a small number like 65537, 
         chosen to be coprime with ϕ(n)\phi(n)ϕ(n).
     - d (Private Exponent): Calculated as the modular inverse 
       of e modulo ϕ(n)\phi(n)ϕ(n).



5a. Bingham University is considering the use of symmetric based 
    authentication in curbing falsification of lecture 
    attendance by students whereby, students sign on behalf of 
    other students absent. The university management approaches 
    your company for a solution. You are to present and justify 
    your choice based on the three types of authentication 
    narrowing your answer to a particular technology. (8 Marks)
ans: a. Symmetric-Based Authentication
        Scenario: Bingham University wants to curb falsification of lecture attendance.
        Solution: Use a secure mobile app with cryptographic 
        signatures to verify student attendance. The app 
        generates a unique, time-sensitive code that students 
        must enter during the lecture.

b. In practice there is no universally trusted entity in the 
   distribution of certificates. With the aid of a diagram, 
   explain the process of distributing certificates and how 
   domains are managed. (8 Marks)
ans:  The process of distributing certificates involves:
      1. Certificate Authority (CA): Issues and signs certificates.
      2. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): Manages keys and certificates.
      3. Domain Management: Ensures certificates are correctly associated with domain names.
      Diagram:

      User -> RA -> CA -> RA -> User -> Domain Server -> User
    |---------------------- (certificate distribution) ----------------------|

c. Assume Alice and Bob want to exchange some messages with data 
   integrity. Is hashing the message and sending the hash along 
   with the message enough? Explain your answer. (4 Marks)
ans: No.
     Explanation:
     - Hashing Alone: Only ensures that the message hasn't 
       changed. If an attacker intercepts the message, they can 
       modify both the message and its hash to match the new 
       message.
     - Solution: Use a Hash-Based Message Authentication Code 
       (HMAC). HMAC combines a secret key with the message 
       before hashing, ensuring that only someone with the 
       secret key can generate a valid hash.
     - Benefit: Ensures both data integrity and authenticity. An 
       attacker can't alter the message or hash without knowing 
       the secret key.

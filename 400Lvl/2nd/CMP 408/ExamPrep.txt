Introduction to Cryptography
















2a. What does the greek word Cryptography mean?
ans: (crypto) - secret
     (graphy) - writing

b. What is Cryptography?
ans: It is the art of mangling information into apparent unintelligibility 
     in a manner allowing a secret method of unmangling
     or
     It‚Äôs the art of creating and using codes to secure transmission of 
     information
     
     Additionally:
     It allows the transformation of a plaintext (cleartext) into a 
     ciphertext and vice versa 
     - Plaintext ü°™ciphertext = encryption 
     - Ciphertext ü°™plaintext = decryption

c. List 4 reasons why Cryptography is needed?
ans: - It Protects stored data 
     - Protects data in transit 
     - Provides protection against 
       - Data eavesdropping and Tampering with data 
     - Could be easily used for authentication purposes

d. What is Cryptanalysis?
ans: It is the art of obtaining original message from ciphertext without 
     access to secret information (key or algorithm itself)

e. What is Cryptology?
ans: It is the combination of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis

f. Discuss "When Did it all start" Cryptography?
ans: 
- Julius Caesar (sometime BC) ! 
  - A substitution cipher 
  - The Caesar cipher replaces the ith letter by the i+3th letter 
    - CAT becomes FDW 
    - Wraps around to A from Z 
- Generalised in monoalphabetic ciphers 
  - No restriction (such as i ü°™i+3) on which letter could be 
    assigned to which 
    - E.g. A is encrypted as B, B as D, C as Z, D as A, etc. 
    - 26! possible monoalphabetic ciphers (4x1026) 
  - Stronger than Julius Caesar, but would you use it? 
    - NO ! Vulnerable to statistical analysis 
  - Most common English letters? 

g. Discuss "What happened next"?
ans: - Vigenere Cipher 
       - Not his 
       - First appeared in Rome in ‚ÄúLa cifra del. Sig. 
         Giovan Battista Bellaso‚Äù, in 1553 
       - ‚ÄúLe chiffre ind√©chiffrable‚Äù for about 3 
          centuries 
       - Similar to a Caesar cipher but has a variable 
         shift value 
         - First letter shifted by 5, second by 17, third by 11 
         - 5, 17 and 11 are defined by a secret 
         - The values range is 0 to 25 (A to Z): A is 0, Z is 25

g1. Encrypt HACKNOW using CAT (With the vigenere Cipher)?
ans: Slide 4 (page 7)

h. Keeping an algorithm secret prevents _______ from knowing it ü°™they 
   cannot break it. This is also known as _________
ans: crackers, Security through obscurity

h. Why should Crypto algorithms be kept secret?
ans: - Keeping an algorithm secret prevents crackers from knowing it ü°™they 
       cannot break it 
       - Security through obscurity 
     - Difficult in practice 
       - Each time you use the algorithm with someone, they need to learn  
         it (and might leak it?) 
       - If it is implemented in some hardware, reverse-engineering it 
         could reveal the algorithm
     - Making an algorithm available makes it possible for crackers to do 
       all tests on the algorithm 
       -  And all the good guys too 
       -  As a good guy finds a loophole, she warns people 
     - Fundamental Tenet of Cryptography 
       - ‚ÄúIf lots of smart people failed to solve a problem, then it 
         probably won't be solved (soon)‚Äù 
     - Nowadays, most of commercial algorithms are public, whereas some 
       military algorithms are kept secret
     - Kirchhoff's principle 
       - A cryptographic algorithm must not be required to be secret, and 
         it must be able to fall into the hands of the enemy without 
         inconvenience 
       - Its key must be communicable and retainable without the help of 
         written notes, and changeable or modifiable at the will of the 
         correspondents 
     - The only secret in the system should be the key 


i. Discuss how difficult it is to find a key?
ans: - Assume you are using an algorithm with a 16 bit key 
       - 216 (=16384) possible keys 
       - If a computer can test 100 keys/sec, then it will take a bit less 
         than 3 minutes to try all of them 
         - brute-force 
       - And, in average, half that time to find the right key 
       - This time doubles for each added bit (0 or 1) 
       - For a 24 bit key, the same computer will need almost 20 months to 
         try all combinations 
     - In practice, computers are much faster, but keys are much longer too 
     - We would say that it is computationally infeasible to brute-force a 
       cryptographic algorithm if it required an unreasonable amount of 
       time using the most powerful computers 
     - Note that if the keys are chosen and used by humans, then they have 
       limited choices 
       - 24 bit key is a 3 character key 
       - Say for example that the used characters are upper and lower case 
         and numerals 
       - 26+26+10 = 62 possibilities for each character 
       - 623(=238328) possible keys in all 
       - Takes less than an hour to try all combinations ! 
     - Nowadays, 280 possible combinations are considered feasible

j. List 3 typical attacks used in breaking Crypto Algorithms?
ans: - Ciphertext only
     - Known Plaintext
     - Chosen Plaintext

j1. Explain each of the attacks?
ans: - Ciphertext only:
       - Attacker has access to encrypted messages 
       - The attacker has to try possible keys in turn until one works 
       - The attacker has to be able to recognize that a key actually works 
         - Hence the name recognizable plaintext attack 
       - Problem when dealing with a cipher text that can be decrypted in 
         several ways 
          - Should have many samples 
          - Does not occur with modern crypto algorithms (too randomised 
            outputs) 

     - Known Plaintext:
       - The attacker obtained pairs of plain and cipher texts 
       - Could be because the meaning of the ciphertext was revealed 
         - Attack? Yes, no 
         - Next target? 
       - Should prevent attackers from getting those pairs 
         - Adding a sequence number 

     - Chosen Plaintext
       - The attacker can choose the plaintext and make the system encrypt 
         it!
       - Real life example: WEP 
         - In WEP, the access point can send random numbers to the station 
         (e.g. laptop) and the station encrypts and returns it 
         - An attacker could pretend to be the access point 
       - Same if there are only few possible meanings of the ciphertext 
         - E.g. YES or NO

h. List 3 types of Crypto (or Cryptographic) Algorithm?
ans: - Secret Key Algorithms
     - Public Key algorithms
     - Hash algorithms

h1. Explain each algorithm above?
ans: - Secret Key Algorithms: 
       - Most intuitive: same key for encryption and decryption 
       - Also known as Symmetric Cryptography 
       - Many uses in secure systems, one of the most obvious ones is 
         confidentiality 
       - The two communication parties have to find a way of sharing the 
         key before communicating 
         - More on this later

     - Public Key algorithms:
       - Keys work in pairs 
       - When a key is used to encrypt, only the other one can decrypt 
       - Can encrypt with either; different uses 
       - Also known as Asymmetric Cryptography 
       - Typically one key is kept secret (private key), the other one is 
         made public (public key) 
       - Many uses in secure systems, one of the most obvious ones is 
         authentication 
       - The two communication parties have to find a way of sharing public 
         key(s?) before communicating 
         - More on this later

     - Hash algorithms:
       - A one-way transformation 
         - If h is a hash function such that y=(h), then it is 
           computationally infeasible for a user who has h and y to find x
           (or an x‚Äô ?such that h(x‚Äô)=y) 
       - Gives a fixed length output, whatever the input size is 
         - MD5‚Äôs is 128, SHA-1‚Äôs is 160 
       - The output is sometimes called hash, digest or checksum 
       - Many uses in secure systems, one of the most common ones is 
         digital signatures 
         - More on this later 











SLIDE 5
Secret Key Cryptography






















5a. List 4 Common uses of Secret Key Cryptography?
ans: - Confidentiality: sender and receiver share a secret and use it 
       to communicate
     - Secure storage: encrypt content before storing it
     - Authentication: share a key and prove that you know it when being 
       authenticated
     - Integrity: instead of having a simple cleartext checksum, encrypt it 
       - Becomes Message Integrity Check or Code

b. Name the 2 techniques used for Secret Key Cryptography?
ans: - Stream ciphers
     - Block ciphers

b1. Explain both techniques above?
ans: - Stream ciphers: can encrypt any size
       - Are based on random number generators
       - The generated random number string has the same size as the data
     - Block ciphers: encrypt fixed size blocks
       - The data to be encrypted is split into blocks of a predefined size
       - If the block is smaller than that size, then padding bits are 
         added before encryption (e.g. add zeros at the end)
       - Example: DES and IDEA use 64 bit blocks, AES uses 128 bit block

c. Discuss Stream Cipher?
ans: - Generates a random string: Keystream
       - Not to be confused with the shared Key
     - XORs it with the message to be encrypted
     - The random string is not really random
       - Pseudo-random
     - The pseudo-random string is used only once
       - One-time pad
     - RC4 is one of the most widely known stream ciphers
       - Used in WEP and in one version of WPA (TKIP)
       - Designed in 1987 and leaked out in 1994
       - Ron‚Äôs (Rivest) Code?
       - Rivest Cipher 4?

b. Give some examples of prime numbers?
ans: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ... and so on

c. What are Relatively prime numbers?
ans: X and Y are relatively prime if they do not have any 
     common divider other than 1. e.g 9 and 10 are relatively 
     prime

d. What is the totient function ùúë(n)?
ans: It is a function that gives the number of numbers 
     smaller than n that are relatively prime to n

d1. What is the result of the below totient functons?
    - ùúë(4) = ? 
    - ùúë(5) = ? 
    - ùúë(6) = ?
    - ùúë(10) = ? 
    - ùúë(143) = ?
ans: - ùúë(4) = 2
     - ùúë(5) = 4
     - ùúë(6) = 2
     - ùúë(10) = 4
     - ùúë(143) = 120

     e.g The below shows how to find such?
     ùúë(12)
     - find prime factors of 12
     2*2*3
     - numbers found should be distinct
     2*3
     - use below formula
     = 12*(1-1/prime factor)*(1-1/prime factor)
     = 12*(1-1/2)*(1-1/3)
     = 4

e. Find the below?
   - 7 mod 4 = ?
   - 10 mod 2 = ?
   - 4 mod 3 = ?
   - 5 mod 8 = ?
ans: - 7 mod 4 = 3
     - 10 mod 2 = 0
     - 4 mod 3 = 
     - 5 mod 8 = ?

     e.g How does it work?
     1. 7 mod 4 = ?
     Basically the answer is the remainder of 7/4
     7 is divided by 4 = 1 times, and the remainder is = 3
     ANSWER = 3

     2. 9 mod 2 = ?
     Basically the answer is the remainder of 8/2
     8 is divided by 2 = 4 times, and the remainder is = 1
     ANSWER = 1

     3. 2 mod 5 = ?
     Basically the answer will always be the left number if 
     the right number is greater than the left number
     ANSWER = 2

f. Find the below?
   - 13+17 mod 5 = ?
   - 8+11 mod 6 = ?
ans: - 13+17 mod 5 = ((13 mod 5) + (17 mod 5)) mod 5 
                   = (3 + 2) mod 5
                   = 5 mod 5
                   = 0

     - 8+11 mod 6  = ((8 mod 6) + (11 mod 6)) mod 6
                   = (2 + 5) mod 6
                   = 7 mod 6
                   = 1


g. Find the below?
   - 7*9 mod 5 = ?
   - 13*8 mod 6 = ?
ans: - 7*9 mod 5 = ((7 mod 5) * (9 mod 5)) mod 5 
                   = (2 * 4) mod 5
                   = 8 mod 5
                   = 3

     - 13*8 mod 6  = ((13 mod 6) * (8 mod 6)) mod 6
                   = (1 * 2) mod 6
                   = 2 mod 6
                   = 2

h1. Does 4 have a multiplicative inverse of mod 3?
ans: The goal is to find b, such that the calculation
     results in an answer of 1 as shown below
     
     (4*b) mod 3 = 1

     So lets try b = 3 to see:
     4*3 mod 3 = ((4 mod 3) * (3 mod 3)) mod 3
               = (1*0) mod 3
               = 0 mod 3
               = 0 (b=3 is Incorrect because we did not get 1 as our result)

     So lets try b=7 to see: 
     4*7 mod 3 = ((4 mod 3) * (7 mod 3)) mod 3
               = (1*4) mod 3
               = 4 mod 3
               = 1 (b=7 is Correct because we got 1 as our result, therefore 7 is the multiplicative inverse of 4 mod 3) ‚úÖ

h2. Does 4 have a multiplicative inverse mod 8?
ans: # Try it urself

h3. Does 4 have a multiplicative inverse mod 6?
ans: # Try it urself













SLIDE 7
Hash Functions


















7a. What is a Hash Function?
ans: A hash function is like a special machine that turns any 
     input (like a message) into a fixed-size number
     e.g a hash function might turn a message into a 128-bit
         number

b. List the 2 key properties of Hash Functions?
ans: - One-Way: If you have the output, it‚Äôs very hard to 
       figure out the original input
     - Collision-Free: It‚Äôs very hard to find two different 
       messages that give the same hash

c. Mention 2 common hash functions?
ans: MD5 (Produces a 128-bit hash)
     SHA-1 (Produces a 160-bit hash)

d. What is the feasibility of finding collisions in theory and in practice?
ans: In Theory: You might find two different inputs that 
                produce the same hash.
     In Practice: Finding two such inputs is extremely 
                  difficult and usually not feasible with 
                  current technology.

e. What is Data Integrity?
ans: It is ensuring that a message hasn‚Äôt been changed or 
     tampered with

f. Assume Alice and Bob want to exchange some messages with 
   data integrity. Is hashing the message and sending the hash along with the message enough?
ans: Simple Hashing Isn‚Äôt Enough:
     - Just sending the hash along with the message isn't 
       secure enough. Attackers could modify the message and 
       create a new hash that still matches.
     Solution: Use a Keyed Hash
     - Keyed Hash: Use a secret key along with the message to 
       make the hash. This makes it much harder for attackers 
       to fake a valid hash.

g. What does the acronym HMAC stand for?
ans: Hash-based Message Authentication code

g1. How does HMAC work?
ans: - Step 1: Compute a hash of the message with one key 
       (K1)
     - Step 2: Compute a final hash using another key (K2) 
       with the result from Step 1
     - If the key is too long, it‚Äôs shortened or hashed first 
       to fit the required size (512 bits)
     - Why Two Keys? 
       Helps protect against certain types of attacks and 
       ensures that the hash cannot be forged easily













SLIDE 8
Symmetric Authentication


















8a. What is Authentication?
ans: - It‚Äôs about making sure a person is who they say they 
       are.
     - It ensures that the data hasn‚Äôt been changed on its 
       way from the sender to the receiver.
     - Comes before ensuring privacy and data correctness.
     - You need authentication to grant permissions 
       (authorization).

b. List the 3 types of Authentication?
ans: - Something I Am:
       Using something unique about you, like your fingerprint or face.
     - Something I Know:
       Using a secret you know, like a password.
     - Something I Possess:
       Using something you have, like a key card or a phone.

c. Which is the weakest but the most common type of 
   authentication?
ans: Something I know

d. What is Password Based Authentication?
ans: It's using a secret word or phrase to prove who you are.

e. List the strengths and weaknesses of Password Based 
   Authentication?
ans: - Weakest Type: Passwords can be copied or stolen
       without you knowing.
     - Most Common Today: Despite weaknesses, passwords are 
       widely used

f. How do attackers Break Passwords?
ans: They use information they know about you:
     - Names of family members or pets.
     - Addresses or phone numbers.
     - Car registration numbers.

g. List 5 characteristics of a good password?
ans: - Never make it a real word - too vulnerable to 
       dictionary attacks and guessing
     - Always should be easy to remember and hard to guess
     - Should be a combination of UPPER and lower case, 
       numerals, letters and punctuation
     - Should be reasonably long
       - 6 characters is only equivalent to a 40bit symmetric 
         key
       - Need about 22 random characters to be equivalent to 
         128 bit key

h. How can the login process be protected?
ans: - By making the login process slow (e.g. add a 1 
       second delay between each login)
     - By keeping a record of failed login attempts and 
       temporarily disabling a login if a limit is exceeded 
       (ATM Machines)  
     - Ask the user to carry out an action which requires 
       human intervention
       - Recognising letters inside an image
       - Recognising a word in a sound file

i. List 2 Common Authentication Methods? 
ans: - Kerberos: A secure way to prove your identity over a 
                 network.
     - Diffie-Hellman: A method for securely exchanging keys 
                       over a public channel.

...












SLIDE 9
ASymmetric Authentication


















9a. Discuss Asymmetric Authentication?
ans: - Each user has a 
       - public key and
       - private key
     - it's not possible to derive one key from the other
     - One key is known by only one entity (private key) 
     - The other key is known by everyone (public key)
     - Both keys can be used for encryption
     - Using public keys for encryption ensures confidentiality 
     - Using private keys for encryption ensures authentication

b. How does the private key work per user?
ans: - Only Alice (a particular user example) can make it
     - Everybody else can verify it

c. What does alice need to know to prove her identity to multiple users
   (Using Asymmetric Encryption)?
ans: Her private key
     Note:
     With Symmetric encryption, Alice would need a separate key for each 
     user

d. What is the major problem  with Asymmetric Encryption?
ans: Asymmetric encryption is slower and requires more processing power 
     compared to symmetric encryption and hash techniques.

e. How does Asymmetric Encryption for Authentication work?
ans: Instead of signing the whole message, Alice signs a summary (hash) of 
     the message.

f. Discuss hash?
ans: - A hash is like a digital fingerprint of a message.
     - Each message produces a unique hash.
     - Given a hash, you cannot easily find the original message.
     - Example Hash Algorithms: MD5 and SHA-1 (producing 128-bit or 160-bit 
       hashes).

g. Draw a diagram of how hashing works?
ans: Slide 9 (page 8)

h. The signature is trusted if and only if ____________?
ans: No one except its owner can produce it 

i. When the owner of the private key produces it, what next?
ans: The private key can then be stored in an encrypted file, protected 
     by a password 
     OR
     It can also be stored in a smart card protected by a password or PIN 

j. In a context where each user may need to prove his identity to others.   
   What must happen?
ans: Each user needs to know the public keys of the other users

k. How are these keys distributed securely?
ans: - Certificates are used to distribute public keys securely.
     - Certificate chains link certificates back to a trusted CA 
       (certificate authority)

l. What are the 2 Certificate formats?
ans: - X.509: A CA issues certificates to users and subordinate CAs.
     - PGP: (Pretty Good Privacy) Users issue their own certificates and 
            others can sign them to certify their authenticity.

m. What are the 3 Trust Models?
ans: - Monopoly Model (Centralized): one universally trusted entity
     - Oligarchy: many trust anchors e.g Used in Browsers
     - Anarchy (Web of Trust): anyone can sign a certificate for anyone else
                               e.g PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)

n. When is Certificate Revocation Needed?
ans: A certificate might need to be revoked if:
     - The private key is stolen.
     - An employee is fired.
     - A user forgets their password.

o. What are the  methods used for Revocation by x.509?
ans: - Uses Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to list revoked 
       certificates.
     - Uses Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to check certificate 
       validity in real-time.

p. What are the methods used for Revocation by PGP?
ans: - Each signer can revoke their own signatures.
     - Only the key owner can revoke their public key, but a designated 
       revoker can be specified.

p. Who can Revoke Certificates?
ans: - X.509:
       - CRLs are published in the same way as certificates and stored in 
         directories and on web pages.
       - PKIX (Public Key Infrastructure X.509) defines OCSP to check 
         certificate validity.
     - PGP:
       - Revoked signatures are sent to key servers and friends












SLIDE 10
SSL/TLS

















10a. What is SSL/TLS?
ans: SSL/TLS is a technology that's used to secure web communication by 
     addressing several security issues

b. What does SSL and TLS stand for?
ans: SSL: Secure Sockets Layer
     TLS: Transport Layer Security


c. Why SSL/TLS?
ans: To eliminate
     - Modification of message/traffic in transit 
     - Impersonation of users (Fake users) 
     - Data forgery (Data created by an intruder are considered to be 
       genuine) 
     - Eavesdropping on the net (Loss of privacy)

d. List the 3 Web Security Requirement?
ans: - Data Integrity
     - Confidentiality
     - Authentication

d1. Explain each of the Requirements listed above?
ans: - Data Integrity: Ensures that the received data is the same as when 
       sent by the sender (using checksums, message authentication codes)
     - Confidentiality: Protection of data from unauthorized disclosure 
       (using encryption)
     - Authentication: The proof of the communicating entity is the one it 
       pretends to be. It's essential on the server side, optional on the 
       client one (using challenge-response, username/password, 
       certificates, ...)

e. What are the Objectives of SSL/TLS: 
ans: - Allow two entities to authenticate
     - Establish session keys

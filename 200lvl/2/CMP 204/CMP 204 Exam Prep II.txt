EXAM PREP II






FILE ORGANIZATION


1a. What is a database?
 Ans: A database is a stored as a collection of files

 b. Each file is a sequence of records and a record is a sequence of fields. true or false? Ans: true
 
 c. What are the approaches to organizing records in files?
 Ans: – Assume the record size is fixed
      – Each file has records of one particular type only
      – Different files are (typically) used for different relations

 Fixed-Length Records
 d. What are the simple approach to Fixed-Length Records?
 Ans: –	Store record i starting at byte n∗(i−1), where n is the size of each record.
      – Record access is simple but records may span blocks.

 e. Approaches to deletion of record i(alternatives to avoid fragmentation)
 Ans: –	move records i +1,...,n to i,...,n −1
      –	move record n to i
      –	Link all free records in a free list

 Free List
 a. Maintained in the blocks that contains _____________?
 Ans: deleted records

 b. Store the address of the first record whose content is deleted in the file header
    Use this first record to store the address of the second available record, and so on. One can think of these stored 
    addresses as pointers, because they “point” to the location of a record. (linked list)

 c. More space efficient representation: reuse space for normal attributes of free records to _________?
 Ans: store pointers

 d. Requires careful programming: Dangling pointers occur if a record is moved or deleted and another record contains a pointer 
    to this record; that pointer then doesn’t point any longer to the desired record. true or false?
 Ans: true

 
 Variable-Length Records
 a. Variable-length records arise in database systems in several ways. Name them?
 Ans: –	Storage of multiple record types in a file.
      –	Record types that allow variable length for one or more fields (e.g., varchar)

 b. Approaches to store variable length?
 Ans: 1. End-of-Record marker
         – difficult to reuse space of deleted records (fragmentation)
         – no space for a record to grow (e.g., due to an update); requires moving
      2. Field delimiters (e.g., a $)
          – requires scan of record to get to n-th field value
          – requires a field for a null value

      3. Each record has an array of field offsets
          + For the overhead of the offset, we get direct access to any field
          + Null values: begin/end pointer of a field point to the same address

 c. Variable length records typically cause problems in case of (record) attribute modifications. List 3?
 Ans: - Growth of a field requires shifting all other fields
      - A modified record may no longer fit into the block (leave forwarding address at the old location)
      - A record can span multiple blocks



 Block formats for variable length records
 d. Each record is identified by a ____________?
 Ans: Record Identifier(rid) (or tuple identifier (tid))

 e. The rid/tid contains ____________ and ____________?
 Ans: Number of block and position in block

 f. __________ simplifies shifting a record from one position/block to another position/block?
 Ans: rid/tid

 g. Allocation of records in a block is based on ____________?
 Ans: slotted block structure

 h. Block header contains ______________, _______________, and _______________?
 Ans: number of record entries, 
      end of the free space in the block, and 
      location and size of each record

 i. How are records inserted into a block. The start of the block or the end of the block?
 Ans: the end of the block

 j. Can records be moved around in block and why?
 Ans: Yes they can, to keep them contiguous(side-by-side)

 h. What is the full meaning of rid?
 Ans: Record Identifier

 

 Organization of Records in Files
 a. A file must efficiently support three(3) things?
 Ans: -	insert/delete/update of a record
      -	access to a record (typically using rid)
      - scan of all records
 
 b. List the ways to organize blocks (pages) in a file?
 Ans: Heap File (unsorted file): simplest file structure; contains records in no particular order; record can be placed anywhere in the file where there is space
      Sequential File: records are stored in sequential order, based on the value of the search key of each record
      Clustered Index: related to sequential files

 c. Which of the following stores record in no particular order: Heap File, Sequential File, Clustered Index?
 Ans: Heap File

 
 1. Heap File Organization
 d. At DB run-time, pages/blocks are allocated and ___________?
 Ans: deallocated

 c. Information to be maintained for a heap file includes. List 3?
 Ans: Pages, free space on pages, records on a page

 f. Typical implementation of a heap file is based on two ____________?
 Ans: doubly linked list of pages; starting with header block

 g. Two lists can be associated with header block including
 Ans: 1) full page list, and 
      2) list of pages having free space

 

 2. Sequential File Organization
 h. Sequential File are suitable for applications that require sequential(ordered) processing of the entire file. true or false?
 Ans: true

 i. The records in the file are ordered by a __________?
 Ans: search-key

 j. Deletions of records are managed using __________?
 Ans: pointer chains

 k. How are Insertions done in Seqeuential Files?
 Ans: Must locate the position in the file where the record is to be inserted
      –	if there is free space, insert the record there
      – if no free space, insert the record in an overflow block
      – in either case, pointer chain must be updated

 l. If many record modifications (in particular insertions and deletions). Correspondence between search key order and physical order can be totally lost. This is called?
 Ans: File reorganization

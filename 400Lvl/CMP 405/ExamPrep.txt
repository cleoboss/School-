COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND MULTIMEDIA






1a. Computer graphics is a rapidly evolving field. true or false?
ans: true

b. Until the past two decades graphics was mainly a realm of artist. now, 
   computer graphics has touched the lives of not only artist and Engineers 
   but also the common man in various ways
ans: Big facts

c. By graphics we will refer to any _______, _______, _______ or 
   other materials to pictorially depict an object or process or otherwise 
   convey information, as a supplement to or instead of written description
ans: sketch, drawing, special artwork

d. How are pictures or graphic objects represented?
ans: Pictures (or graphic objects) are represented as a collection of 
     discrete picture elements called pixels (picture element)

e. What is a Pixel?
ans: A pixel is the smallest addressable screen element
     OR
     it is the smallest piece of display screen which we can control

f. How is the control of a Pixel achieved?
ans: By setting the intensity and color of the pixel (which composes the 
     screen)

g. List 6 advantages of Computer Graphics?
ans:
    - It provides tools for producing pictures not only of concrete 
      real-world object but also of abstract, synthetic object such as 
      mathematical surfaces in 4D and of data that have no inherent 
      geometry such as Survey results.

    - It has the ability to show moving pictures and thus it is possible to 
      produce animation with computer graphics. 

    - With computer graphics users can also control the animation speed, 
      portion of the view and goniometer relationship of the object in the 
      scene to one another and the amount of detail shown.

    - Computer graphics provide tools called motion dynamics. With this, 
      the user can move and tumble object with respect to stationary 
      observer, or he can make an object stationary and the viewer moves 
      around them. A typical example is walk through made by builders to 
      show flat interior and building surroundings. in many cases it is 
      possible to move both objects and viewer.

    - Computer graphics also provides facilities called update dynamics. 
      With update dynamics it is possible to change the shape, color or other properties of the objects being viewed.

    - With the recent development of digital signal processing and audio 
      synthesis chip the interactive graphics can now provide audio 
      feedback along with the graphical feedback to make the simulated 
      environment even more realistic.

f. Explain how Computer accepts inputs from the keyboard?
ans: When we press a key, a tiny chip in the keyboard called keyboard 
     controller notes that a key has been pressed. The keyboard controller 
     places a code (Key Scan) in the buffer of the keyboard to indicate 
     which key was pressed (Keyboard buffer is a temporary memory of the 
     keyboard controller). The keyboard controller sends a signal to the 
     system software notifying that something happened at the keyboard

     When the system receives the signal it determines the appropriate 
     response. When a keystroke has occurred, the system reads the memory 
     location in the keyboard buffer that contains the code of the key 
     which was pressed. The system software then passes that code to the 
     CPU

Random Scan display

4a. Random Scan display is also called ___________?
ans: Vector display

b. How does Random Scan Display work?
ans: the electron beam is directed only to the areas of screen where a 
     picture has to be drawn. As it draws picture one line at a time. It 
     can draw and refresh component lines of a picture in any specified 
     sequence. Pen plotter is an example of random-scan displays. The 
     number of lines regulates refresh rate on random-scan displays. An 
     area of memory called refresh display files stores picture definition 
     as a set of line drawing commands

     The system returns back to first-line command in the list, after all 
     the drawing commands have been processed. High-quality vector systems 
     can handle around 100, 00 short lines at this refresh rate. Faster 
     refreshing can burn phosphor. To avoid this every refresh cycle is 
     delayed to prevent refresh rate greater than 60 frames per second.

b1. Give me an example of a random scan display?
ans: Pen plotter

b2. ____________ regulates the refresh rate on a random-scan display?
ans: number of lines

c. Draw a diagram of the Random Scan Display?

ans: That means it is refreshing the image 144 times per second

d4. When paired with the high frame rates produced by a GPU and CPU working 
    together, this can result in a smoother experience and potentially 
    higher FPS
ans: true

d5. Draw a diagram to show the difference of 120hz, 60hz and 30hz?

g. CRT is based on ____________ technology?
ans: television

h. How does Raster Scan Display work?
ans: In raster scan system electron beam sweeps across the screen, from top 
     to bottom covering one row at a time. 

     A pattern of illuminated pattern of spots is created by turning beam 
     intensity on and off as it moves across each row. A memory area called 
     refresh buffer or frame buffer stores picture definition. This memory 
     area holds intensity values for all screen points. Stored intensity 
     values are restored from frame buffer and painted on screen taking one 
     row at a time. Each screen point is referred to as pixels.

i. _____________ stores picture definition in Raster scan displays?

     times per second (by cycling through the picture data stored in the 
     refresh buffer)
 

 Direct-View Storage Tube
 
l. What is a DVST?
ans: DVST (Direct-View Storage Tube) is an alternative method of

     where:
     m = slope of a line
     b = the y intercept

     [we can find values of y by incrementing x from x =x1, to x = x2. By scan-converting these calculated x, y values, we represent the line as a sequence of pixels]

   y1), we get a __________ 
ans: line segment

k. In the case of computer graphics, we can not directly join any two 
   coordinate points, for that we must calculate intermediate points 
   coordinates and put a pixel for each intermediate point, of the desired 
   color with help of functions
ans: true

l. List the 5 steps involved in Calculating DDA?
ans: Step 1 − Get the input of two endpoints (X0,Y0) and (X1,Y1).
     Step 2 − Calculate the difference between two endpoints.
       dx = X1 - X0
       dy = Y1 - Y0
     Step3 - Based on the calculated difference in step-2, you need to 
             identify the number of steps to put pixel. If dx > dy, then 
             you need more steps in x coordinate; otherwise in y coordinate.
         if (absolute(dx) > absolute(dy))
             Steps = absolute(dx);
         else
             Steps = absolute(dy);
     Step 4 − Calculate the increment in x coordinate and y coordinate.
          Xincrement = dx / (float) steps;
          Yincrement = dy / (float) steps;
     Step 5 − Put the pixel on by successfully incrementing x and y coordinates accordingly and complete the drawing of the line.
          for(int i=0; i < Steps; i++){
             x = x + Xincrement;
             y = y + Yincrement;
             putpixel(Round(x), Round(y));
          }

m. List the advantages of DDA Algorithm?
ans: 1. It is simple and easy to implement algorithm.
     2. It avoid using multiple operations which have high time 
        complexities.
     3. It is faster than the direct use of the line equation because it 
        does not use any floating point multiplication and it calculates 
        points on the line

n. List the disadvantages of DDA Algorithm?
ans: 1. It deals with the rounding off operation and floating point 
        arithmetic so it has high time complexity.
     2. As it is orientation dependent, so it has poor endpoint accuracy.
     3. Due to the limited precision in the floating point representation 
        it produces cumulative error.

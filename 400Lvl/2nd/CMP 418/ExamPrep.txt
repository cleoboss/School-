CMP 418 EXAM PREP
Best Practice: Study using a big screen device. Be it a laptop or a tablet. It won't be best to use phones (even though y'all ain't with your phones üòâ)

1a. What is an Algorithm?
ans: A sequence of unambiguous instruction for solving a problem that 
is, for obtaining a required output for any legitimate input in a 
finite amount of time

b. List 5 properties of Algorithms?
ans: 
- Finiteness: terminates after a finite number of steps.
- Definiteness: each step must be rigorously and unambiguously specified, 
  e.g., ‚Äústir until lumpy‚Äù
- Input: valid inputs must be clearly specified
- Output: data that result upon completion of the algorithm must be specified
- Effectiveness: steps must be simple and basic, e.g., check if m is prime

c. Draw the diagram of Algorithm Design and Analysis Process??
ans: Slide 1 (page 5)

d. Explain what takes place in the first 2 steps of Algorithm design?
ans: 
1. Understanding the Problem
   - Ask questions, do a few small examples by hand, think about special cases, etc.
   - An input is an instance of the problem the algorithm solves
   - Specify exactly the set of instances the algorithm needs to handle
2  Decide on Exact vs. approximate solution
   - Approximate solution cannot solve exactly, e.g., extracting square roots, solving 
     definite integrals, etc.
   - Algorithms for exact solution can be unacceptably slow

e. What is Algorithm Design Techniques?
ans: They are the general approach to solving problems algorithmically that is 
     applicable to a variety of problems from different areas of computing 

e1. List 5 of these techniques?
ans: 
- Brute force
- Decrease and Conquer
- Divide and Conquer
- Transform and Conquer
- Space and time tradeoffs
- Dynamic Programming

f. Algorithms + DataStructures = (equals)?
ans: Programs

g. List 5 Data Structures?
ans: List, Array, Dictionary, Sets, Queue, Stack

h. Algorithm yields required output for every ________________
ans: legitimate input in finite time

i. List the 2 techniques for proving the correctness?
ans: Exact algorithm
     Approximate algorithm

k. List 4 ways of analyzing an Algorithm?
ans: 
- Time efficiency: how fast it runs
- Space efficiency: How much extra memory it uses
- Simplicity: easier to understand, usually contains fewer bugs, sometimes simpler is more
  efficient, but not always!
- Generality: of the problem algorithm solves or the set of inputs it accepts

l. List 5 important problem types?
ans:
- Sorting
- Searching
- String processing
- Graph problem
- Combinatorial Problem 
- Geometric Problem 
- Numerical Problem

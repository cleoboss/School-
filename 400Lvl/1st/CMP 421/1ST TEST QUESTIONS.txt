CMP 421 - Net-Centric Computing Test
1a. What do you think are the reasons for the Increasing Importance of Multi-processors
 b. With the aid of a diagram, Explain any 2 types of Multi-processor

2a. Differentiate between Parallel computing and distributed computing
 b. With the aid of a diagram, explain the concept of Distributed Computing model


ANSWERS
CMP 421 - Net-Centric Computing Test
1a. - To increase the overall throughput of the system
    - To enhance fault tolerance [If a processor fails we would have another to cover up] through redundancy
    - Multi-tasking
    ... and more (read the note)

 b. Loosely coupled
    Draw the diagram of loosely coupled systems
    - It has a distributed Memory [Each cpu has a memory that are separate from one another]
    - It does not encounter memory conflicts
    - It has lower data rates 
    - Less expensive, but large r in size
    - It uses NTC for inter......[check your note to complete]
    ... and more (read the note)

    Tightly coupled
    - It has a shared memory
    - It encounters memory conflicts
    - High data rates
    ... and more (read the note)

2a. Check your notebook for this one (was what Mr. gaga said)
 b. With the aid of a diagram, explain the concept of Distributed Computing 
 model
 c. Draw the diagram of all 5 and explain them. They are listed below
    1. Minicomputer
    2. Workstation Model
    3. Workstation-server model
    4. Processor-pool model
    5. Hybrid model


EXTRA:
- Read about Handover and understand all 4 types of handovers
  - Intra-cell handover
  - Inter-cell handover / intra-BSC handover
  - Inter-BSC, intra-MSC handover
  - Inter MSC handover
  and also know how to draw the "Handover decision" diagram 

Tip: 
What is Handover
- As u move from one location to another with your mobile device, the signal strength of the BTS your device is connected to keeps on reducing until it hands over to another BTS with stronger connection, it does this brilliantly and this is shown in the handover decision diagram (slide page 85)

- The users, the problem, and the principles

Note:
I asked state the requirements / principles in the assignment I recently gave this is where ur main marks will come from

Note:
Also, everyone must submit a hard copy version of their project, if not you will get ur individual ZERO

You are not getting marks for beautiful design, but you'll be getting marks for the principles, data analysis and things as such

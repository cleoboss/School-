5TH LECTURE (I missed this class -> Lotta's Note down below)

WHAT WE'VE COVERED ABOUT TODAY'S CLASS

Mr. Barka introduced us to 2 new websites that would help us on our website creation

The first was:
https://smallseotools.com/keywords-suggestions-tool/

Here he talked about how to use the keyword checker, this helps to create content for our webpage by suggesting trending topic ideas with the keyword we type into the search box.

Also, he introduced us to the Plagiarism checker. This helps us confirm if our content is original or stolen, in order to avoid copyright issues.


Next was: https://www.reduceimages.com/

This website helps us to properly size any image we decide to use on our website, and also adjust the image quality in order for the image to look visually appealing

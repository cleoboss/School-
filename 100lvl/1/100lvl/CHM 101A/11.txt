NOTICE: PLEASE, kindly check your course registration forms, the CORRECT TITLE for CHM 101 is, ...CHM 101A-PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY.....
if your form is carrying CHM 101-GENERAL CHEMISTRY it is WRONG, please kindly go and print another form with the correct TITLE and bring for me to sign.

I will sign only the CORRECT CHM 101-PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY on the new form and then you will attach it to the old form and submit to your departments.

BUT, if your form already carries CHM 101-PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, then it is alright, you do not need to print a new form.

Thank you.

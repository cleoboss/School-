1a. What is a Model?
ans: A Model is a human construct that helps us understand the real world 
    systems

b. A Model is usually made up of _______, _______ and _______ sub-systems?
ans: Input, processing, output

c. Another definition for Model is?
ans: A model in general is a pattern, plan, miniaturized representation, 
     or description designed to show the main object or workings of an 
     object, system, or concept. Is this a valid definition of a model

d. In science, Models are often ______________________?
ans: theoretical constructs (that represent any particular thing with a 
     set of variables and a set of logical or quantitative 
     relationships between them)

e. Models in science are constructed to enable ________________?
ans: reasoning within an idealized logical framework

f. What is Modelling?
ans: Modelling is the process of generating abstract, conceptual, 
     graphical and/or mathematical models.

     or 

     The process of finding relations between systems and models

g. What is Simulation?
ans: it is the manipulation of a model in such a way that it operates on 
     time or space to compress it, thus enabling one to perceive the 
     interactions that would not otherwise be apparent because of their 
     separation in time or space

h. Why Modelling and Simulations?
ans: - When there is significant uncertainty regarding the outcome or 
       consequences of a particular alternative under consideration. 
       It allows you to deal with uncertainty and imprecision in a 
       quantifiable way

     - When the system under consideration involves complex interactions 
       and requires input from multiple disciplines. In this case, it is 
       difficult for any one person to easily understand the system. A 
       simulation of the model can in such situations act as the framework 
       to integrate the various components in order to better understand 
       their interactions.
       As such, it becomes a management tool that keeps you focused on the 
       "big picture" without getting lost in unimportant details

     - when the consequences of a proposed action, plan or design cannot 
       be directly and immediately observed (i.e., the consequences are 
       delayed in time and/or dispersed in space) and/or it is simply 
       impractical or prohibitively expensive to test the alternatives 
       directly  

i. What is another definition for Simulation?
ans: A Simulation of a system is the operation of a model, which is a 
     representation of that system

     of a particular system

m. Computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical  
   modelling of many natural systems in physics, chemistry and

ans: physical sciences and other sciences where there is governing theory 
     that can guide the construction of mathematical models based on 
     differential equations

t1. The term ‚Äúequation based‚Äù here refers to ____________________?

          equations governing their interaction
     2. field-based:
        - where there is a set of equations governing the time evolution

ans: two groups in the society (e.g. two different races, boys 
and girls, smokers and non-smokers, etc.)

t17. ‚Äú
- Each square on the board represented a house, with at most one person per
  house.
- An individual is happy if he/she has a certain percent of neighbors of 
  his/her own group. 
- Happy agents stay where they are, unhappy agents move to free locations
‚Äù
Schelling found that the board quickly evolved into a strongly segregated 
location pattern if the agents' ‚Äúhappiness rules‚Äù were specified so that 
segregation was heavily favored.

Surprisingly, however, he also found that initially integrated boards 
tipped into full segregation even if the agents' happiness rules expressed 
only a mild preference for having neighbors of their own type
ans: Noted













Multiscale Simulation

2a. Some simulation models are hybrids of different kinds of modeling methods. ___________ happens to be one of them?
ans: Multiscale

b. What is Multiscale Simulation models?
ans: it's a simulation model that couples together modeling elements from 
     different scales of description.

c. Give a good example of this?
ans: A good example of this would be a model that simulates the dynamics 
     of bulk matter by treating the material as a field undergoing stress 
     and strain at a relatively coarse level of description, but which 
     zooms into particular regions of the material where important small 
     scale effects are taking place, and models those smaller regions with 
     relatively more fine-grained modeling methods (Such methods might rely 
     on molecular dynamics, or quantum mechanics, or both‚Äîeach of which is 
     a more fine-grained description of matter than is offered by treating 
     the material as a field)

d. Multiscale Simulation can be broken down into __________ and ___________?
ans: - Serial multiscale methods and 
     - Parrallel multiscale methods

e. Which amongst both is the more traditional method?
ans: serial multi-scale modeling

f. How does serial multi-scale modeling work?
ans: it chooses a region, simulate it at the lower level of description, 
     summarize the results into a set of parameters digestible by the 
     higher level model, and pass them up to into the part of the algorithm 
     calculating at the higher level

g. When are Serial multiscale methods not effective?
ans: When the different scales are strongly coupled together

h. When the different scales interact strongly to produce the observed 
   behavior, what is required is an approach that simulates each region 
   simultaneously. This is called ________________?
ans: parallel multiscale modeling

i. Parallel multiscale modeling is the foundation of a nearly ubiquitous 
   simulation method called ________________?
ans: sub-grid modeling

j. What is Sub-grid modeling?
ans: it refers to the representation of important small-scale physical 
     processes that occur at length-scales that cannot be adequately 
     resolved on the grid size of a particular simulation

k. Remember that many simulations discretize continuous equations, so they 
   have a relatively arbitrary finite ‚Äúgrid size.‚Äù
ans: true

l. In the study of turbulence in fluids, for example, a common practical 
   strategy for calculation is to account for the missing small-scale 
   vortices (or eddies) that fall inside the __________
ans: grid cells

l1. How is the above calculated?
ans: This is done by adding to the large-scale motion an eddy viscosity 
     that characterizes the transport and dissipation of energy in the 
     smaller-scale flow‚Äîor any such feature that occurs at too small a scale to be captured by the grid. 

m. In climate science and kindred disciplines, sub-grid modeling is called ________________
ans: parameterization

n. What is Parameterization?
ans: This refers to the method of replacing processes (ones that are 
     too small-scale or complex to be physically represented in the model 
     by a more simple mathematical description)

Note: 
This is as opposed to other processes‚Äîe.g., large-scale flow of the 
atmosphere‚Äîthat are calculated at the grid level in accordance with the 
basic theory. It is called ‚Äúparameterization‚Äù because various non-physical 
parameters are needed to drive the highly approximative algorithms that 
compute the sub-grid values.

o. List some examples of parameterization in climate simulations?
ans: the descent rate of raindrops, 
     the rate of atmospheric radiative transfer, and 
     the rate of cloud formation


Note:

‚Ä¢ For example, the average cloudiness over a 100 km2 grid box is not 
  cleanly related to the average humidity over the box. 
‚Ä¢ Nonetheless, as the average humidity increases, average cloudiness will 
  also increase‚Äîhence there could be a parameter linking average cloudiness to average humidity inside a grid box. 
‚Ä¢ Even though modern-day parameterizations of cloud formation are more 
  sophisticated than this, the basic idea is well illustrated by the 
  example.

p. __________ has argued that the use of sub-grid modeling methods in 
  simulation has important consequences for understanding the structure of 
  the epistemology of simulation
ans: Winsberg (2001)

q. ______________ is a powerful way to understand complex systems and 
   uncertainties?
ans: Monte Carlo Simulations

q1. Imagine playing a game with dice ‚Äì we roll the dice many times to 
    predict the outcome. Monte Carlo simulations work in a similar way, but 
    with ______________?
ans: Mathematical models

q2. Instead of dice, in Monte Carlo Simulations we use ________________?
ans: random numbers - to represent uncertain factors in a system

q3. The random numbers represent _______________________?
ans: uncertain factors in a system

Note: By running these simulations repeatedly, we can explore different 'what-if' scenarios, helping us see how a system behaves under various conditions

This approach is incredibly useful across various fields, like finance, engineering, and
science, where we need to make informed decisions and deal with uncertain
situations

Monte Carlo Simulations

r. In the scientific literature, there is another large class of computer 
   simulations called ____________________
ans: Monte Carlo (MC) Simulations

s. What are MC Simulations?
ans: MC simulations are computer algorithms that use randomness to 
     calculate the properties of a mathematical model (and where the 
     randomness of the algorithm is not a feature of the target model)

t. Give an example of MC Simulations in use?
ans: using a random algorithm to calculate the value of œÄ

u. If you draw a unit square on a piece of paper and inscribe a circle in 
   it, and then randomly drop a collection of objects inside the square, 
   the proportion of objects that land in the circle would be roughly 
   equal to œÄ/4. 
   A computer simulation that simulated a procedure like that would be 
   called a ___________________? 
ans: MC simulation for calculating œÄ.

       (entities) 
     - Frequency at which the entities arrive in the process
     - How long do individual steps in the process take

       and variations in the process













The Modeling Process

3a. What are the steps involved in the Modeling process?
ans: modeling > Computation > Implementation > Virtualization > Validation > Embedding

b. Draw the Modeling Process diagram?
ans: Slide (page 24)

Modeling

c. What takes place at the Modeling stage?
ans: A simplified formal description (of a suitable extract) from the item 
     of interest, which will then serve as the basis for the subsequent computations. 
     It Involves 
     - examining the real world
     - extraction of essential features (from the real world) and 
     - construction of the model (using the extracted essential features)

Computation

d. What takes place at the Computation stage?
ans: The model will be preprocessed (e.g. discretized) so that it is 
     compatible with a computer platform. The solution of this 
     preprocessed model requires the identification of efficient algorithms

Implementation

e. What takes place at the Implementation stage?
ans: The computational algorithms previously determined must be 
     implemented efficiently on the target architecture 
     or architectures. This is essentially translating the algorithms at 
     the computation/simulation level into a software system

Virtualization

f. What takes place at the Visualization (data exploration) stage?
ans: The data resulting from a simulation run must be interpreted. In 
     some cases‚Äîe.g., for scalar quantities such as the drag coefficient 
     in aero dynamics‚Äîthis will be easy, in others‚Äîe.g., for high 
     dimensional data sets‚Äîextracting the relevant information from the 
     flood of numbers is a science of its own

Validation

g. What takes place at the Validation stage?
ans: How reliable are the results? Sources for errors lurk in the model, 
     in the algorithm, in the code or in the interpretation of the results. 
     Therefore, it is important to compare different models, different 
     algorithms, and different codes, as well as simulation results with 
     manual experiments. Depending on the source of the error, the process 
     has to be restarted at the respective step and the pipeline has to be 
     traversed once more starting from this point.

Embedding

h. What takes place at the Embedding stage?
ans: Simulations take place in a context‚Äîe.g., a development or production 
     process‚Äîand should be integrated accordingly. This requires the 
     definition of interfaces, a reasonable software engineering, simple 
     testing environments, etc 


Applications of Modelling

Note:
Modelling finds applications in many industries ‚Äì some are mathematical 
formula heavy and some more descriptive

i. List the applications of modelling?
ans: - Geophysics
     - Drug design
     - Medicine
     - Climate research
     - Weather forecasting
     - Automobile industry
     - Semiconductor industry

SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS

j. What are Systems and Components?
ans: Systems and components refer to the fundamental building blocks of
     complex systems that are studied and analysed

k. Systems are overarching entities composed of ______________?
ans: interconnected components or elements (each of which plays a distinct 
     role in achieving system's objectives)

Note:
- Understanding systems and components is crucial in the context of
  modelling and simulation as it involves identifying, defining, and 
  characterizing the relationships, behaviors, and interactions among these 
  elements

- This knowledge serves as the foundation for creating accurate
  mathematical models and simulations, allowing for the exploration,
  analysis, and optimization of real-world systems in various domains, from
  engineering and economics to healthcare and logistics.

EXAMPLES OF SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS

m. Draw a table that shows an example of Systems and Components?
ans: Slide (page 28)

n. List the 2 types of Models?
ans: - Discrete Models and
     - Continuous Models

Discrete Models

o. Discuss the below relating to Discrete Models?
- Discrete Values
- Time steps
- Applications

ans: Discrete Values: Variables take on discrete and separate values 
     representing integers and countable sets. i.e they exploit discrete or 
     combinatorial descriptions (binary or integer quantities, state 
     transitions in graphs or automata)
     They deal with data that is countable  with finite values that have 
     nothing in-between. E.g count of items, number of students in a class.

     Time steps: Discrete models advance in time through discrete time 
     steps. Events occur at specific time points, and the system's state 
     changes instantaneously at these time steps. This is often represented 
     by a sequence of events or a timeline

     Applications: Discrete models are used computer science (e.g., 
     discrete-event simulation), discrete mathematics, and combinatorics. 
     They are well-suited for systems with distinct states, events, or 
     decisions, such as queuing systems, network protocols, and digital 
     circuits.

p. Discuss the below relating to Continuous Models?
- Continuous Values
- Continuous Time
- Applications

ans: Continuous Values: are based on real-valued or continuous descriptions 
     (real numbers, physical quantities, algebraic equations, differential 
     equations). Deals with data that is measurable containing fractions 
     with decimal values. i.e. variables can take on a wide range of values 
     within a continuous range. These values are often represented by real 
     numbers, e.g. temperature, distance, and time measured in fractions of 
     a second.

     Continuous Time: Continuous models describe systems where time is 
     continuous and flows smoothly, rather than progressing in discrete 
     steps. Changes in the system's state happen smoothly and continuously 
     over time.
     
     Applications: Continuous models are used in physics (e.g., modeling 
     motion and fluid dynamics), engineering (e.g., control systems and structural analysis), and mathematical calculus

q. Draw a Graphical example of Discrete vs Continuous models?
ans: Slide (page 31)

       randomness.
     - They are characterized by fixed, well-defined relationships between 
       variables, where the outcome is entirely determined by the inputs 
       and the model structure.
     - Typically represented by equations, and they produce a single, 
       specific output for a given set of inputs

ans: equations, single & specific

b4. Give me an example of a Deterministic model in use?
ans: a simple linear regression model that predicts a person's weight based 
     on their height (In this model, each height value corresponds to a 
     single, specific weight prediction, assuming no measurement errors or 
     variability)

Stochastic Model 

c. Discuss Stochastic Model?
ans: - Incorporate randomness and uncertainty explicitly into the 
       modeling process.
     - They assume that certain aspects of the system are inherently     
       random, and they account for this randomness using probability 
       distributions.
     - the same set of parameter values and initial conditions will lead to 
       an ensemble of different outputs, (i.e. generate a range of possible 
       outcomes, each with a probability associated with it.)

c1. Stochastic model incorporates ____________ and ____________ explicitly 
    into the modeling process?
ans: randomness, uncertainty 

c2. Stochastic model assumes that certain aspects of the system are 
    ____________ and they account for this randomness using _______________?
ans: inherently random, probability distribution

c3. In a Stochastic model, the same set of parameter values and initial 
    conditions will lead to _______________?
ans: a group of different outputs

c4. Give an example of the Stochastic model in use?
ans: a stock price model that incorporates random fluctuations to account 
     for market volatility 

     extra:
     In this model, the future stock price is not determined with certainty 
     but follows a probability distribution, reflecting the inherent 
     uncertainty in financial markets













Random Numbers

5a. What are Random numbers?
ans: Random numbers are numbers that show no consistent pattern with each 
     number in a series and are neither affected in any way by the 
     preceding number, nor predictable from it

     - Simulations
     - Gaming

c. What is an RNG (Random Number Generator)?
ans: it is a hardware device or software algorithm that generates a number 
     that is taken from a limited or unlimited distribution and outputs it

d. What are the 2 types of Random Numbers?
ans: - Pseudorandom Numbers
     - True Random Numbers

e. Discuss Pseudorandom numbers?
ans: - These numbers are generated by algorithms and are not truly random 
       but appear random.
     - They are deterministic and based on an initial value called a seed 
     - If you use the same seed, you will get the same sequence of numbers 
     - Pseudorandom number generators are widely used in computer programs 
       and applications because they are computationally efficient and sufficient for many purposes

e1. Discuss True Random numbers?
ans: - These numbers are generated from a source of true randomness 
       (such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay). 
     - True random numbers are not predictable and are not generated by 
       algorithms. 
     - They are used in applications that require a high degree of 
       unpredictability and security, such as cryptographic systems.

e2. __________ numbers are generated by algorithms and are not truly 
    random but appear random

    sequence of numbers
ans: Pseudorandom 

e7. __________ numbers are used in applications that require a high degree 
    of unpredictability and security, such as cryptographic systems
ans: True Random

e8. __________ number generators are widely used in computer programs and 
    applications. And why?
ans: - Pseudorandom,
     - Because they are computationally efficient and sufficient for many 
       purposes

f. List all the properties of a Good Random Number Generator?
ans: - Uniform distribution
     - Independence
     - Periodicity
     - Reproducibility
     - Statistically Unpredictable
     - Low Bias
     - Speed and Efficiency
     - Seed Initialization
     - Resistance to Predictive Attacks
     - Periodic Checks

f1. Discuss 5 Good RNG property (from the ones listed above)?
ans: - Uniform Distribution: The RNG should produce numbers that are 
       uniformly distributed across the entire range of possible values. 
       This means that every number within the range has an equal 
       probability of being generated.

     - Independence: Each generated number should be statistically 
       independent of the previous numbers. In other words, the outcome of 
       one random number should not provide any information about the next 
       number.

     -  Periodicity: A good RNG should have a long period, meaning it 
        takes a very long time for the sequence of numbers to repeat. Short periods can lead to predictable and non-random behavior.

     - Reproducibility: While random numbers should be unpredictable, it 
       should be possible to reproduce the same sequence of random numbers 
       when needed by using the same seed value. This is crucial for 
       debugging and reproducibility in simulations.

     - Statistically Unpredictable: The generated numbers should pass 
       various statistical tests for randomness, such as the Chi-squared 
       test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, or spectral test. Passing these tests 
       indicates that the RNG produces numbers that behave like truly 
       random values

g. Draw the Diagram explaining Pseudorandom number generation?
ans: Slide (page 38)

h. Draw the Diagram explaining Congruential Generator
ans: Slide (page 39)

h1. Seed numbers can be generated from __________ and ____________?
ans: - Computer system clock,
     - Intervals between keystrokes (in milliseconds)


Congruential Generator

i. The Congruential Method is a widely used algorithm for generating     
    ___________?
ans: pseudo-random numbers

i1. Note that Pseudo-random numbers are not truly random but are generated 
    using a ______________________________?
ans: deterministic process (that appears random for most practical purposes)

i2. The basic idea of the Congruential Method involves ____________________?
ans: iterating through a sequence of numbers, each of which depends on the 
     previous number

i3. The algorithm uses the following recurrence relation?
ans: Xn+1‚Äã=(aXn‚Äã+c) mod m
     Where:
     - Xn is the current pseudo-random number in the sequence.
     - Xn+1 is the next pseudo-random number in the sequence.
     - a, c, and m are constants chosen to control the properties of the 
       generated sequence

i4. How doe the method work?
ans: - Initialization: You start with an initial seed value, X0. This seed 
       is the starting point for generating the sequence.

     - Iteration: To generate subsequent pseudo-random numbers, you apply 
       the recurrence relation above. Each new number depends on the 
       previous one, and the operation mod m ensures that the result stays 
       within the range [0, m‚àí1].

     - Repeat: You continue this process, generating a sequence of 
       numbers as long as needed. The sequence appears random but  is 
       entirely determined by the choice of constants and the initial seed 
       value.

i5. What are some of the key considerations when using the Congruential Method?
ans: - Choice of constraints
     - Seed value
     - Period length
     - Statistical properties

i6. Explain all the key considerations?
ans: - Choice of constraints
       a: The multiplier, which should be a large prime number or a number 
          with good properties in terms of randomness.
       c: The increment, which is typically a small constant.
       m: The modulus, which determines the range of the generated numbers. 
          It should be a large prime number or a power of two for efficient computation
     
     - Seed value:
       The quality of the pseudo-random sequence depends on the choice of 
       the initial seed value. Different seed values will result in 
       different sequences. A poor choice of the seed can lead to patterns 
       in the generated numbers.

     - Period length:
       The period of the sequence is the number of values it generates 
       before it starts repeating. The choice of constants and the seed 
       value determine the period length. Ideally, you want a long period 
       to avoid quickly repeating sequences

     - Statistical properties
       It's essential to test the generated sequence for statistical 
       properties, such as uniformity and independence, to ensure it is 
       suitable for the intended application

j. What does RANECU stand for?
ans: Random Number ECUniform

k. What is RANECU?
ans: it is a type of random number generator algorithm
     or
     it's a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that produces a sequence of seemingly random numbers

l. The RANECU algorithm is a particular PRNG that was developed by 
   __________ and ___________?
ans: James Gentle, Jean-Hugues R√©ty

m. RABECU is known for it's ______________________?
ans: simplicity and ease of implementation (this makes it suitable of 
     various applications)

n. RANECU algorithm typically involves ___________________________?
ans: a series of mathematical operations on the current seed to generate 
     a new pseudorandom number

o. RANECU is classified as what type of generator?
ans: Lehmer-style generator (which is a type of linear congruential generator (LCG))

p. What are the key features of RANECU. List them?
ans: - Initialization
     - Periodicity
     - Uniformity
     - Efficiency

q. Discuss each key feature of RANECU?
ans: - Initialization: It requires an initial seed value to start 
       generating the random sequence. If the same seed is used, the same 
       sequence of numbers will be generated, making it useful for 
       reproducible results in simulations and testing.
     
     - Periodicity: Like other PRNGs, RANECU has a finite period. This 
       means that after a certain number of iterations, the sequence 
       will repeat itself. The length of the period is an important 
       characteristic of a PRNG.

     - Uniformity: The generated numbers should have good statistical 
       properties and be uniformly distributed, meaning each number in the 
       range of possible outcomes is equally likely.

     - Efficiency: RANECU is often designed to be computationally 
       efficient, making it suitable for use in resource-constrained 
       environments.

       It is important to note that RANECU is just one of many algorithms, 
       and the choice of PRNG depends on the specific requirements of the 
       application, including considerations of randomness, speed, and 
       security.


The Quadratic congruential method

r. What is the Quadratic Congruential Method (QCM)?
ans: is a type of pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that is used to 
     generate sequences of seemingly random numbers

s. QCM is a variation of the more common ___________________?
ans: Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) method

t. LCG generates pseudorandom numbers using _________________?
ans: a linear recurrence equation

u. QCM generates pseudorandom numbers using ________________?
ans: a quadratic recurrence equation

v. Write out the QCM equation?
ans: Xn+1‚Äã=(aXn2‚Äã+bXn‚Äã+c) mod m
     Where:
     - Xn is the current random number.
     - Xn+1 is the next random number in the sequence.
     - a, b, c are coefficients that determine the behavior of the QCM.
     - m is the modulus, which defines the range of possible values

Note:
Just like in linear congruential generators, the values of a, b, c, and m 
are crucial to the quality and statistical properties of the random numbers 
generated by the QCM. Properly chosen values are required to ensure a long 
period (the number of values before the sequence repeats) and good 
randomness properties

w. What are some of the advantages that the QCM have over the LCG?
ans: - Potentially longer periods
     - Better statistical properties (for certain parameter choices)

x. QCM can also be more complex to set up due to the _______________, 
   and not all parameter combinations will produce __________________
ans: - quadratic equation,
     - good random sequences

In Conclussion:

The choice of which PRNG to use depends on the specific requirements of 
the application. Some applications may require higher-quality random 
numbers and might prefer more advanced PRNGs or even true random 
number generators (TRNGs) for cryptographic or security-critical purposes. 
Others may use simpler PRNGs like QCM for non-cryptographic tasks where 
the statistical properties of the generated numbers are less critical

          ‚ñ™ First - In First - Out (FIFO), 
          ‚ñ™ Last - In First - Out (LIFO), 
          ‚ñ™ Service In Random Order (SIRO), 
          ‚ñ™ And Priority Queue
       ----------------------------------------------------

     - Queue Capacity - The limits of the system as per the number of 
       customers in line

         limited queue capacity. 
     - Reneging: 
         customer leaves the queue after waiting in a queue upon arrival. Without being served
     - Jockeying: 
         customer decides to switch to a different queue for earlier 
         service (especially in a parallel queue ‚Äì multi-server queuing 
         model). similar to what we do when on a queue at the atm, we switch/Jockey between lines to get access to an atm earlier

Queuing network

x. What is a Queuing Network?
ans: models where customers (service requests) arrive at service stations 
     (servers) to be served

x1. Queuing networks are classified into types. Name them?
ans: Open and Closed

x2. A token denotes ______________________________________?
ans: any type of customer that requests service at the service facility

x3. What happens in an Open Queuing Network?
ans: each token arrives at the system, based on the arrival rate, and 
     leaves the system after being served

x4. What happens in an Open Queuing Network?
ans: In the closed queuing network, the finite number of tokens is 
     assigned, and each token moves between queues without leaving the 
     system

x5. What is the main difference between these 2 types of Networks?

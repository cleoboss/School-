PHYSICAL LAYER

3a. Discuss the Physical Layer?
 Ans: The physical layer is the layer that interfaces the hardware and the signalling mechanism
      These is the only layer of the OSI Model that handles connectivity
      The physical layer defines all the hardware equipments

 b. What is a signal?
 Ans: A signal is an electrical pulse sent through a wire in the form of voltage

 b1. Main difference between data signal and analogue signals
 Ans: data signals are discrete in nature and represent a sequence of voltages
      analog signals are in continuous waveforms in nature and represent by continuous electromagnetic waves

 c. Discuss analog and digital data?
 Ans: In other to send analog data or digital data, they first needs to be converted
      Analog data such as human voice needs to be converted to analog signals
      Digital data such as a file on a computer needs to be converted to digital signals
 
 d. When signal travels through a medium it tends to deteriorate. Discuss?
 Ans: This is due to the following factors:
      attenuation: When signal travels through a medium it needs to have sufficient strength. If signal is sent over a long medium it grows weaker
      Dispersion: When signals travel through a medium it tends to spread out. This depends on the frequency being used
      Delay distortion: Signals are sent on mediums with predefined speed and capacity. If the signals predefined speed does not match there is a chance it reaches the destination in arbitrary format
      noise: This is the random disturbance or altercation in digital or analog signals

 e. What is Noise and the characteristics of Noise?
 Ans: This is the random disturbance or altercation in digital or analog signals
      Characteristics ->
      Thermal Noise: Heat agitates the conductor which generates noise. to a great extent this is unavoidable
      intermodulation: When multiple frequencies share a medium, there will be interferrences between the frequencies which causes noise
      crosstalk: This is when a foreign signal is introduced into a medium. The signal in one medium affects the signal in the other medium
      Impulse: This occurs due to electricity, lightning, short-circuit, faulty components

 f. What is Transmission Media?
 Ans: Transmission Media is the physical media through which data/information is exchanged between two connected devices

 g. What are the 2 forms of transmission media?
 Ans: Guided: In this, the sender and the reciever are directly connected and then information is sent via UTP, Coaxial cables and fiber optics
      Unguided: In this, the sender spreads the information over the air and anyone can recieve it including the recipient via wireless and open air space

 h. What are the different types of transmission media?
 Ans: Magnetic Media
        This is an old fashioned Networking physical media for data transmission
        Data is stored physically in the media and transported from one station to another
        It is used to backup data by alot of business communites
        And helps companies cut cost

      Twisted pair cables(STP, UTP)
        This cables are made up of two plastic insulated copper wires that are twisted together to reduce noise
        Only one of the cable carries the actual data while the other is used for ground referencing
        There are two types: Shielded Twisted Pair Cables and Unshielded Twisted Pair Cables

      Coaxial Cables
        This cable is made up of two copper wires
        At the core is a solid conductor copper wire
        That is then enclosed in a insulating sheath
        The insulating sheath is then wrapped with the second copper wire
        Then it is all covered with a plastic cover
        - Due to it's stength it can carry higher frequency signals than power line communication

      Power Line Communication
        PLC is a layer-1 technology which uses power cables to transmit data signals
        sends modulated data
        The reciever recieves the demodulates the data and interprets it
        There are two types:
           - narrow band plc
           - broad band plc
      Fiber Optics
        This cables work on the propertise of light
        When a light ray hits at a critical angle it tends to refract by 90 degrees
        Light is emitted on one end and moves through the media and then it is detected on the other using light detector
        The light identifies the light streams and converts it to electrical data
     
          
 h1. What are the following cables connected with: Unshielded twisted pair cable, Coaxial cable, fiber optics?

      Coaxial Cable: RG-59 - for Television transmission, RG-58 - for Thin Ethernet transmission, RG-11 - for Thick Ethernet transmission
 
 h3. RG stands for?
 Ans: Radio Government

 Wireless
 i. What is Wireless transmission?
 Ans: This is a form of unguided transmission media. There is no physical link between two or more devices. The data is spread over the air and the reciever recieves the data
      using the appropriate antenna

 j. How are wireless signals transmitted?
 Ans: In a wireless device the antenna in the electric circuit takes digital data and converts it into electrical signals and then spreads it over the air within its frequency range
      The reciever recieves this signal and converts it back to digital data

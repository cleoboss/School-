ANSWERS

1. Define the following:
   a. Language
   Ans: A language is any notation used for communication of ideas and information

   b. Programming language
   Ans: A programming language is a special notation used for communicating with computer systems

   c. Lexicon
   Ans: Lexicon is the complete set of meaningful units in a language 

   d. Syntax
   Ans: Syntax are the rules that govern the combination of valid words

   e. Semantics
   Ans: Semantics is the meaning associated with a particular syntactic entity

   f. Syntax Tree
   Ans: Syntax Tree is a tree-like diagram that shows the structure of a sentence by breaking 
        it down into its constituent parts

   g. Meta Language
   Ans: Meta Language are languages used in describing the structure of other languages

   h. BNF
   Ans: BNF is a notation in computing used in writing grammar that are commonly used to 
        specify the syntax of programming languages 


2. Define the following:
   a. Symbol
   Ans: A symbol is a single character. eg   a, b, c, 0, 1, 2 e.t.c 

   b. Alphabet
   Ans: An Alphabet is a finite set of symbols. Denoted by Σ. e.g Σ = {a, b, c}

   c. String
   Ans: A String is a finite sequence of characters. e.g a, b, c, aa, bb, ab, bc e.tc

   d. Empty String
   Ans: An Empty String is one with 0 occurrences of symbols. No Symbol.


3. Define the following:
   a. Equivalent Grammars
   Ans: Equivalent grammars are grammars with the exact same parse tree

   b. Ambiguous Grammar
   Ans: Ambiguous Grammar is a grammar with more than 1 parse tree

   c. Recursive Grammar
   Ans: Recursive Grammars are grammars who are often defined in terms of themselves 

   d. Left-Factoring
   Ans: Left-Factoring is the process of transforming the grammar with common prefixes of alternatives

   e. Left Most Derivation and Right Most Derivation (LMD & RMD)
   Ans: LMD is the process of replacing the LHS of the derivation to the RHS
        RMD is the process of replacing the RHS of the derivation to the LHS


4. Define the following:
   a. Derivation
   Ans: Derivation is the sequence of production rules in order to get an input string

   b. Parsing
   Ans: is the process of recognizing a string in a language by breaking it down to
        a set of symbols and analyzing each of them against the grammar of the language

   c. Parse Tree
   Ans: it is a graphical depiction of a derivation

   d. Sentential form
   Ans: It is any string derivable form the start symbol of a production rule


5. Define the following
   a. Automata Theory 
   Ans: is the study of abstract computing devices on computational models

   b. Dead State 
   Ans: Is a state that doesn't lead to the final state

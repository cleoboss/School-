CMP 441 Christmas Group Project

Remember the questions you are asking are to understand the problem which should influence your design. Don't be asking people their height which doesn't help you understand the problem

Except if a question is specific and tells us about a specific problem, avoid yes and no questions. You might ask two people the same question and both might say yes but when u ask them why they said yes their response might be totally different. This is why it's best to avoid yes or no questions

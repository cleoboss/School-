     multiple computers in a network

j. List some of the challenges in building Distributed Operating Systems
ans: - Designing a distributed operating system is more difficult than designing a 
       centralised operating system.
     - It is assumed that the operating system has access to complete and accurate 
       information about the environment in which it is functioning. However, a 
       distributed operating system must be designed with the assumption that complete 
       information about the system environment will never be available.
     - In a distributed system, the resources are physically separated, there is no 
       common clock among the multiple processors, delivery of messages is delayed, 
       messages could even be lost.
     - Due to the above reasons, a distributed operating system does not have up-to-date 
       consistent knowledge about the state of the various components of the underlying 
       distributed system.
     - Despite these complexities and difficulties, a distributed operating system must 
       be designed to provide all the advantages of distributed system to its user. That 
       is the users should be able to virtue centralised system that is flexible, 
       efficient, secure and easy to use.

     - Failure and 
     - Persistence Transparency

o. List some of the issues of Transparency when designing a Distributed System?
ans: - Access transparency enables users to be unaware of the distribution of files. 
       The files could be present on a totally different set of servers which are 
       physically distant apart and a single set of operations should be provided to 
       access these remote files.
     - Location transparency enables sources to be accessed without knowledge their 
       physical or remote location.
     - Failure transparency enables the concealment of faults, allowing users and 
       application programs to complete their task despite the failure of hardware 
       or software components.
     - Concurrency transparency enables several processes to operate concurrently using 
       shared resources without interference between them
     - Scaling transparency enables a system to grow without affecting application 
       algorithm. Note graceful growth and evolution is an important requirement for 
       most enterprises.
     - Performance transparency enables systems to be reconfigured to improve the 
       performance if the need arises.
     - Migration transparency enables the users to be unaware of the movement of 
       information of processes within a system without affecting the operations of the 
       users and the applications hat are running.

--

y. List some of the factors that determine the quality of communication
ans: - Line-of-sight propagation. This is the ideal transmission of signals, without 
       refraction, diffraction, or scattering in between the transmitter and the 
       receiver, but losses do occur.
     - Attenuation. When obstacles are greater in size than signal wavelength, the 
       strength of the signal decreases e.g. A GSM 900 MHz ( Î» > = 33 cm) signal, will 
       face attenuation in objects of size > 1 m (>> Î»~33cm)
     - Scattering. When obstacle size is equal to or less than wavelength. This 
       decreases signal strength greatly e.g. A GSM signal, about 33 cm in wavelength, 
       scattered by an object of 30 cm or less makes only a small part of the scattered 
       signal to reach the receive
     - Diffraction. A signal bends from the edges of an obstacle of size equal to or less 
       than the wavelength e.g. A GSM signal of wavelength 33 cm will diffract from an 
       object of 33 cm or less causing it to or not to reach its destination
     - Reflection. A signal may also be reflected from the surface of an obstacle, or 
       the earthâ€™s surface e.g. A GSM 900 MHz ( Î»= 33 cm) signal the transmitter signal 
       reflects from an object of size 10 m and above (much greater than Î»)

j. Draw a diagram of the steps taken in Mobile Terminated Call (MTC)?
ans: Slide (page 78)

k. Outline all the steps involved?
ans: - Step 1: User dials the phone number of GSM subscriber
     - Step 2: The fixed network (PSTN) identifies the number belongs to a user in GSM 
               network and forwards the call setup to the Gateway MSC (GMSC).
     - Step 3: the GMSC identifies the HLR for the subscriber and signals the call setup 
               to HLR
     - Step 4: The HLR checks for number existence and its subscribed services and 
               requests an MSRN from the current VLR.
     - Step 5: VLR sends the MSRN to HLR
     - Step 6: Upon receiving MSRN, the HLR determines the MSC responsible for MS and 
               forwards the information to the GMSC.
     - Step 7: the GMSC can now forward the call setup request for the MSC indicated.
     - Step 8: The MSC requests the VLR for the current status of the MS
     - Step 9: VLR sends the requested information
     - Step 10: if MS is available, the MSC initiates paging in all calls it is responsible 
                for
     - Step 11: The BTSs  of all BSSs transmit the paging signal to the MS
     - Step 12: Step 13: if MS answers, VLR performs security checks

     - Step 3: The MSC then checks if this user is allowed to set up a call with the 
               request and checks the availability of resources through GSM network 
               and into the PSTN. If all resources are available, the MSC sets up a 
               connection between the MS and the fixed network.









HANDOVER

10a. Cellular systems require handover procedures, as single cells ____________________
ans: do not cover the whole service area

b. A Handover should not cause a _________?
ans: cut-off (also called a call drop)

c. GSM aims at maximum handover duration of ____?
ans: 60ms

d. What are the 2 basic reasons for a handover?
ans: 1. The mobile station moves out of the range of a BTS, decreasing the received 
        signal level increasing the error rate thereby diminishing the quality of the 
        radio link.
     2. Handover may be due to load balancing, when an MSC/BSC decides the traffic is 
        too high in one cell and shifts some MS to other cells with a lower load

e. Draw a diagram showing the 4 possible handover scenarios of GMS?
ans: Slide (page 83)

e1. Discuss all 4 possible handover scenarios?
ans: - Intra-cell handover: Within  a cell, narrow-band interference could make 
       transmission as a certain frequency impossible. The BSC could then decide 
       to change the carrier frequency (scenario I).
     - Inter-cell, intra-BSC handover: This is a typical handover scenario. The mobile 
       station moves from one cell to another, but stays within the control of the same 
       BSC. The BSC then performs a handover, assigns a new radio channel in the new 
       cell and releases the old one (scenario 2)
     - Inter-BSC, intra-MSC handover: As a BSC only controls a limited number of cell, 
       GSM also has to performs a handover between cells controlled by different BSCs. 
       This handover then has to be controlled by the MSC (scenario 3).
     - Inter MSC handover: A handover could be required between two cells belonging 
       to different MSCs. Now both MSCs perform the handover together (scenario 4)

f. Draw a diagram of the Handover decision depending on receive level?
ans: Slide (page 85)

g. To provide all the necessary information for a handover due to a weak link, MS and 
   BTS both perform _______________________________________
ans: periodic measurements of the downlink and uplink quality respectively

h. Measurement reports are sent by the MS about every half-second and contain the quality 
   of the current link used for transmission as well as the quality of certain channels 
   in neighbouring cells.true or false?
ans: true

     - Eves dropping
     - Spoofing
     - Repudiation
     - Indirect attacks

j1. Explain all the terms above?
ans: - Vulnerability: is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a systemâ€™s 
       information assurance. Vulnerability is the intersection of three elements: a 
       system susceptibility or flaw, attacker access to the flaw and attacker capability 
       to exploit the flaw

     - Backdoors: In computer system, a backdoor is a method of bypassing normal 
       authentication, securing remote access to a computer, obtaining access to plan 
       text and so on, while attempting to remain undectated.
       The backdoor may take the form of an installed program or could be a modification 
       of an existing program or hardware device. It may also take information about 
       disk and memory usage
     
     - Denial of Service attack: This attack is designed to render services unusable.
       Attacker can deny serviced to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password so many times to cause the victim account to be lucked or overloading the capabilities of the system or network and block all users at once for example a 
       worm Trojan horse etc

     - Direct access attacks: An unauthorised user gaining physical access to a computer, 
       the attacker can perform many functions, install different types of device to 
       compromise security, including operating system modifications, software worms, 
       key loppers and convert listening devices

     - Eves dropping: is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation, 
       typically between hosts on a network. For example security organizations.

     - Spoofing: is where an attacker (person or program) successfully masquerades as 
       another by falsifying data and thereby gaining an illegitimate advantage

     - Repudiation: is where the authenticity of a signature is being challenged

     - Indirect attacks: is an attack launched by a third party computer. It usually 
       becomes far more difficult to track down the actual attacker

       letters, numbers, special characters (minimum 10 characters in total) and 
       change them on a regular basis.

     - Secure your Computer
       - Activate Firewall: firewall are the first line of Cyber defence, they block 
         connection to unknown or bogus sites and will keep out some types of virus 
         and hackers.
       - Antiâ€“Virus/Malware Software: Install and regularly update anti-virus software 
         to prevent virus from infecting your computer.
       - Block spyware attacks: install and updating anti-spyware software to prevent 
         spyware from infiltrating your computer.

     - Be careful using social media: make sure your social networking profiles 
       (egFacebook, Twitter, Youtube, MSN, etc) are set on private. Ensure your 
       security setting are properly configure and be careful on what information you 
       post online. 

     - Secure your mobile devices: Be aware that your mobile devices is vulnerable 
       to viruses and hackers. Download application from trusted sources only.

     - Install the latest operating system update . Keep your applications and 
       operating system (e.g Windows, Linux, Mac, etc) current with the latest system 
       updates. Turn-on automatic updates to prevent potentials attackers on older 
       software.

     - Protect your Data: Use encryption for your most sensitive files and make regular 
       back-up of all your important data and store it in another locations.

     - Secure your Wireless network: Wifi networks at home or public places are 
       vulnerable to intrusion if they are not properly secured. Always review and 
       modify the defaults settings.

     - Protect your e-identity: Make sure your personal information or financial 
       information are giving only on security websites.

     - Avoid being scammed: always think before you click on a link or file of unknown 
       origin. Donâ€™t feel pressured by e-mails, always check the source of the message. 
       Never reply to e-mails that ask you to verify your information or confirm your 
       sensitive information online.

l. What are the principles of Information Security?
ans: - Confidentiality
     - Integrity
     - Availability
     - Non-Repudiation
     - Authentication

l1. Discuss the principles?
ans: - Confidentiality: Sometimes refer to privacy. This involve all measures undertaken 
       to ensure confidentiality are designed to prevent sensitive information from 
       reaching wrong people, while making sure that the right people can get it. 
       That is, access is restricted to those only authorised. Safeguarding data 
       confidentiality may involve special training on security risk that could threaten 
       the information and the use of strong passwords. 

     - Integrity: Involve maintaining the consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of 
       data over its entire life cycle. Data must not be changed in transit, and steps 
       must be taken to ensure that data cannot be altered by unauthorised person. This 
       can be achieved through the use of file permission and user access control.
       
     - Availability: is best ensure by rigorously maintaining all hardware, correctly 
       functioning operating system environment that is free of software conflicts. It 
       also important to keep current with all necessary system upgrades. Providing 
       adequate communication bandwidth and preventing the occurrence of bottlenecks

     - Non-Repudiation: is the assurance that someone cannot deny something. It is the     
       presentation of unforgetable evidence that a message was sent or received. If 
       messages or transactions can be disputed, then important identity actions can be challenged and jeopardised.

     - Authentication: is the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or 
       process. It is the mechanism of associating an incoming request with a set of 
       identifying credentials. The credentials provided are compared to those on a 
       file in  a database of the authorised userâ€™s information on a local operating 
       system or within an authentication server.

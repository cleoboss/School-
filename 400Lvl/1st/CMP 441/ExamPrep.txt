Human Computer Interaction (HCI)



Introduction

1a. What is HCI?
ans: it's a field of computer science concerned with studying how people 
     relate with computers and how to make that interaction better (more natural)

b. A central concern of interaction design is to _________________________?
ans: develop interactive products that are usable

c. Why are we studying HCI?
ans: - It contributes to and over laps with many disciplines (IS, SE, 
       Graphics, Industrial Design etc)
     - Many people are involved in it: Interaction design is idealy carried 
       out by multidisciplinary teams, where the skill sets of engineers, 
       designers, programmers, psychologists, anthropologists, 
       sociologists, marketing people, artists, toy makers, product 
       managers, and others
     - It's a viable career path (UI/UX Designers, Researchers)

d. Products should be designed to support the activities of _____?
ans: users

e. Designing interactive products requires?
ans: - Considering who is going to be using them, how they are going to be 
       used, and where they are going to be used.
     - Understanding the kind of activities people are doing when 
       interacting with these products.

f. What is the process of Interaction design?
ans: - Interaction design has specific activities focused on discovering 
       requirements for the product, designing something to fulfil those 
       requirements, and producing prototypes that are then evaluated.
     - Interaction design focuses attention on users and their goals.

g. List the 4 Activities in Interaction Design?
ans: 1. Discovering requirements for the interactive product
     2. Designing alternatives that meet those requirements
     3. Prototyping the alternative designs so that they can be 
        communicated and assessed
     4. Evaluating the product and the user experience it offers throughout 
        the process

h. Draw the User-Centered Design diagram?
ans: Slide (page 10)

i. Draw a diagram showing the Interaction Design Life Cycle?
ans: Slide (page 11)

............................................

Activity
Imagine that you want to design a product that helps you organize a trip. This might before a business or vacation trip, to visit relatives halfway around the world, or for a bike ride on the weekend—whatever kind of trip you like. In addition to planning the route or booking tickets, the product may help to check visa requirements, arrange guided tours, investigate the facilities at a location, and so on.

1. Using the first three phases of the double diamond of design, produce
   an initial design using a sketch or two, showing its main functionality 
   and its general look and feel. This activity omits the fourth phase, as 
   you are not expected to deliver a working solution.

2. Now reflect on how your activities fell into these phases. What did you
   do first? What was your instinct to do first? Did you have any particular
   artifacts or experiences upon which to base your design?

............................................

Discover (understand the problem)

j. How does one go about Discovery?
ans: - The artifact’s use and target domain are investigated by taking a 
       user-centered approach to development, users’ opinions and reactions 
       to early designs are sought, and users are involved appropriately in 
       the development process itself.
     - Understand what is currently the user experience or the product, why 
       a change is needed, and how this change will improve the user 
       experience


Understanding the Problem
k. What are some of the questions you should ask?
ans: - Are there problems with an existing product? 
       - If so, what are they?
         - Why do you think there are problems?
     - Why do you think your proposed ideas might be useful?
       - How do you envision people integrating your proposed design with
         how they currently do things in their everyday or working lives?
     - How will your proposed design support people in their activities? In 
       what way does it address an identified problem or extend current 
       ways of doing things? Will it really help?

ans: - Mental models
     - Information processing
     - External cognition

     - Mental models: 
         develop knowledge of how to use the system and, to a lesser extent, how the system works. Mental models have been postulated as internal constructions of some aspect of the external world that are manipulated enabling predictions and inferences to be made
     - Information processing: 
         Information is thought to enter and exit the mind through a series of ordered processing stages. Within these stages, various processes are assumed to act upon mental representations

         1. externalizing to reduce memory load
         2. computational offloading
         3. annotating and cognitive tracing

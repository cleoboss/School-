DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE 
Faculty of Science and Technology 
SECOND SEMESTER EXAMINATION 2022/2023 SESSION 
COURSE CODE: CMP 416, COURSE TITTLE: Web Development Issues 
(Section A: Legal Aspect, Section B: Computer System Aspect) 
TIME ALLOWED: 2 Hours, 
INSTRUCTIONS: Attempt Only Two Questions under Section A and 
              Two Questions under Section B. 
       
SECTION A: 
1. Rehab Tanko, reincarnated as a neoclassical existentialist 
   poet, gave a poetry recital at the ring your heart Concert 
   Hall of the Bingham University arena for intellectual display 
   (better known as "BUAID") On this occasion, she extemporized 
   her poetry, a fancy way of saying she made it up on the spot. 
   Mario ("The Memory") Martinez, a student with an exceptional 
   memory, returned home afterwards and wrote down from memory 
   one of Rehab Tanko's extemporized poems. He published it 
   under the name "Conversations." Does Tabitha have a claim for 
   copyright infringement against Mario? If yes, what will be 
   your justification for the protection of intellectual 
   property right. 

2. "We are sleepwalking into a surveillance society" this was a 
   statement attributed to Richard Thomas, UK Information 
   Commissioner (Dec 2018) how true is this statement in the 
   light of the massive threat to national security and the need 
   to maintain an effective balance between the right to Privacy 
   of person and property rights and the overall security of 
   lives. 

3. JoJo and Nikos are both employees of a large IT company, 
   Orange Computers. JoJo is angry with Nikos regarding an 
   argument they had earlier in the day and goes to Nikos’ 
   office to confront him. Upon arriving at Nikos’ office JoJo 
   realises that Nikos has left his computer logged in. JoJo 
   sits down at Nikos’ desk and opens and looks through several 
   of the files saved on Nikos’ computer. JoJo feels bad about 
   this, as Nikos has always told him “You must never look 
   through my computer, I will never give you permission to do 
   this”. Later, when JoJo gets home, he has calmed down and has 
   forgiven Nikos for their argument. Instead, JoJo believes 
   that his boss at Orange Computers is to blame for the 
   argument. He decides, therefore, to send a large volume of 
   emails to his boss’s email address, which causes the server 
   hosting this email address to crash. All email addresses 
   hosted on the server become inoperative for a week as a 
   result. Following this, JoJo sends Nikos an email apologising 
   for their argument, but accidentally sends Nikos a virus 
   which deletes all the contents of Nikos’ computer. In 
   relation to the above events, consider whether JoJo has 
   committed any criminal offences under the Computer Misuse Act

ANSWERS 










1. Rehab Tanko, reincarnated as a neoclassical existentialist 
   poet, gave a poetry recital at the ring your heart Concert 
   Hall of the Bingham University arena for intellectual display 
   (better known as "BUAID") On this occasion, she extemporized 
   her poetry, a fancy way of saying she made it up on the spot. 
   Mario ("The Memory") Martinez, a student with an exceptional 
   memory, returned home afterwards and wrote down from memory 
   one of Rehab Tanko's extemporized poems. He published it 
   under the name "Conversations." Does Tabitha have a claim for 
   copyright infringement against Mario? If yes, what will be 
   your justification for the protection of intellectual 
   property right. 
Ans: Yes, Rehab Tanko has a valid claim for copyright 
     infringement against Mario Martinez. Justification for this 
     claim includes:

     - Originality and Fixation: Even though the poem was 
       extemporized, if Rehab Tanko’s work was original and 
       fixed in some tangible medium (even orally), it is 
       protected by copyright. Mario's act of writing down and 
       publishing the poem constitutes copying, thus infringing 
       on Rehab's rights.

     - Intellectual Property Rights: These rights are designed 
       to protect the creator’s original works. Publishing the 
       poem without Rehab’s permission violates her exclusive 
       rights to reproduce, distribute, and display the work.


2. "We are sleepwalking into a surveillance society" this was a 
   statement attributed to Richard Thomas, UK Information 
   Commissioner (Dec 2018) how true is this statement in the 
   light of the massive threat to national security and the need 
   to maintain an effective balance between the right to Privacy 
   of person and property rights and the overall security of 
   lives. 
Ans: This statement underscores the tension between the need for 
     security and the protection of individual privacy.
     
     - True in Many Contexts: In many countries, there has been 
       a significant increase in surveillance for security 
       purposes, such as CCTV, internet monitoring, and data 
       collection.

     - Privacy Concerns: This surveillance often infringes on 
       individuals' privacy rights, creating a society where 
       personal data is constantly monitored.

     - Balance: Effective laws and regulations must balance 
       security needs with privacy rights, ensuring that 
       surveillance measures are necessary, proportionate, and 
       transparent.


3. JoJo and Nikos are both employees of a large IT company, 
   Orange Computers. JoJo is angry with Nikos regarding an 
   argument they had earlier in the day and goes to Nikos’ 
   office to confront him. Upon arriving at Nikos’ office JoJo 
   realises that Nikos has left his computer logged in. JoJo 
   sits down at Nikos’ desk and opens and looks through several 
   of the files saved on Nikos’ computer. JoJo feels bad about 
   this, as Nikos has always told him “You must never look 
   through my computer, I will never give you permission to do 
   this”. Later, when JoJo gets home, he has calmed down and has 
   forgiven Nikos for their argument. Instead, JoJo believes 
   that his boss at Orange Computers is to blame for the 
   argument. He decides, therefore, to send a large volume of 
   emails to his boss’s email address, which causes the server 
   hosting this email address to crash. All email addresses 
   hosted on the server become inoperative for a week as a 
   result. Following this, JoJo sends Nikos an email apologising 
   for their argument, but accidentally sends Nikos a virus 
   which deletes all the contents of Nikos’ computer. In 
   relation to the above events, consider whether JoJo has 
   committed any criminal offences under the Computer Misuse Act 
Ans: JoJo’s actions potentially violate several provisions of 
     the Computer Misuse Act:
     
     - Unauthorized Access: JoJo accessed Nikos' computer 
       without permission, which constitutes unauthorized access.
     
     - Email Bombing: Sending a large volume of emails to crash 
       the server is a form of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, 
       causing disruption and damage.
     
     - Virus Transmission: Sending a virus that deletes all 
       contents of Nikos' computer constitutes unauthorized 
       modification of data.

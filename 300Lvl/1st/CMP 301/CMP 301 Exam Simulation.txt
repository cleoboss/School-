ANSWERS


1. Define the following:
   a. Computer Architecture (CA)
   ans: Computer Architecture is the science & art of selecting and interconnecting 
        hardware components to create computers that meet function, performance and cost goals 

   b. Logic Circuit
   ans: Logic Circuit is an electronic circuit that performs logical operations 
        by taking one or more input and producing a desired output

   c. Truth Table (TT)
   ans: TT is a mathematical table used to define a logic function by specifying 
        the outputs for every possible input combination

   d. Logic Gate?
   ans: Logic Gate are the basic building block of any digital system. 
        They help perform operations such as AND, OR, NOT e.t.c

   in the full and literal sense". who said this and when?
ans: (Haugeland, 1985)

d. "[The automation of] activities that we associate with human thinking, 
   activities such as decision-making, problem solving, learning...” who 
   said this and when?
ans: (Bellman, 1978)

Turing Test
e. Who designed the Turing Test and in what year?
ans: Alan Turing in 1950

f. What is a Turing Test?
ans: it's a test performed to determine a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior

g. Explain how this test works?
ans: The basic concept behind the test is that if a human judge is engaged 
     in a natural language conversation with a computer where he cannot 
     reliably distinguish machine from human, the machine passes the test

     Note that the Responses from both participants in the conversation are 
     received in the form of a text-only channel.

     During the Turing test, the human questioner asks a series of questions to both respondents. After the 
     specified time, the questioner tries to decide which terminal is operated by the human respondent and which terminal is operated by the computer

h. Draw the Turing test diagram
ans: Slide 1 (page 10)

i. Are the below statements true about the Turing Test? 
- The Turing test is used to measure a machine's ability to think and it's 
  an important concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence
- A machine’s success at thinking can be quantified by the likelihood that 
  a human will misidentify it as a human subject.
ans: Yes they are

Turing Test (Imitation Game)
j. A  computer's ability to think can also be determined through an 
   imitation game. true or false?
ans: true

k. Explain the Imitation Game?
ans: In this game, there are three players A, B and C. 
     Player A is a man, B a woman and C is of either sex. C cannot see A 
     and B, and communicates with the others through written notes.

     Player C determines which of the others is a man and which is a woman 
     by asking a series of questions. Player A tricks the interrogator into 
     making the wrong decision, while B attempts to guide C toward the 
     right path. 

l. Draw a diagram of the Imitation Game?
ans: Slide 1 (page 14)

m. Explain how the original Imitation game test was?
ans: In the original imitation game test, Turing proposes A to be a computer. The computer pretends to be a 
     woman and tricks the interrogator into making an incorrect evaluation. The machine's success is 
     determined by comparing the outcome of the game when A is a computer against when A is a man. If the 
     interrogator goes wrong when playing the game between man and woman, the computer is assessed to be intelligent

     Note: 
     There are some variations on the interpretation of how a Turing test should be performed but the basic 
     premise is whether a human judge can determine whether he is talking to a machine or another human.

SLIDE 5

5a. A knowledge representation language is defined by two aspects. 
    List and explain them?
ans: - Syntax: The syntax of a language defines which configurations of 
       the components of the language constitute valid sentences.
     - Semantics: The semantics defines which facts in the world the 
       sentences refer to, and hence the statement about the world that 
       each sentence makes.

b. List and explain 4 properties that a good knowledge representation
   System should have
ans: - Representational Adequacy: the ability to represent all the 
       different kinds of knowledge that might be needed in that domain.
     - Inferential Adequacy: the ability to manipulate the representational 
       structures to derive new structures (corresponding to new knowledge) 
       from existing structures.
     - Inferential Efficiency: the ability to incorporate additional 
       information into the knowledge structure which can be used to focus 
       the attention of the inference mechanisms in the most promising 
       directions.
     - Acquisitioned Efficiency: the ability to acquire new information 
       easily. Ideally the agent should be able to control its own 
       knowledge acquisition, but direct insertion of information by a 
       ‘knowledge engineer’ would be acceptable  

c. The theoretical requirements for good knowledge representations can 
   usually be achieved by dealing appropriately with a number of 
   practical requirements. List 7?
ans: - The representations need to be complete
     - They must be computable

ans: - The lexical part: 
         it determines which symbols or words are used in the 
         representation’s vocabulary
     - The structural or syntactic part: 
         it describes the constraints on how the symbols can be arranged, 
         ie. a grammar
     - The semantic part:
         it establishes a way of associating real world meanings with the 
         representations
     - The procedural part:
         it specifies the access procedures that enables ways of creating 
         and modifying representations and answering questions using them,

   systems they are rather ________
ans: limited

l. List 2 advantages of Traditional database systems?
ans: - Databases are well suited for efficiently representing and 
       processing large amounts of data (and derivation from a database is 
       virtually independent of its size)
     - We can build on traditional database systems to process more complex 
       and more powerful representational devices (e.g. frames)

m. List 3 disadvantages of Traditional database systems?
ans: - Only simple aspects of the problem domain can be accommodated
     - We can represent entities, and relationships between entities, but 
       not much more
     - Reasoning is very simple – basically the only reasoning possible is 
       simple lookup, and we usually need more sophisticated processing 
       than that.

     Disadvantage
     - There is no generally efficient 
     - procedure for processing knowledge

Rule Based System
s. What do Rule Based Systems consist of?
ans: - A database management system for handling the domain specific facts
     - A rule set for representing the knowledge structure/relations
     - A rule interpreter to carry out the problem solving.

t. Give an example of a typical Rule set?
ans: - R1.IF Raining ∧ Outside(x) ∧ HasUmbrella(x) THEN UseUmbrella(x)
     - R2.IF Raining ∧ Outside(x) ∧ ¬HasUmbrella(x) THEN GetsWet(x)
     - R3.IF GetsWet(x) THEN CatchCold(x)
     - R4.IF Sunny ∧ Outside(x) THEN GetSunBurnt(x)

t1. How do we derive knowledge in Rule based systems?
ans: If we have a knowledge base consisting of facts and rules, and a rule 
     interpreter to match the rule conditions against the facts, and a 
     means for extracting the rules, then we can derive new knowledge.

     For example, using the above rule set:
     - Suppose we have three initial facts: Raining, Outside(John), 
     ¬HasUmbrella(John)
     
     - Then only the rule R2 with ‘x = John’ matches the facts, so we are able to infer
     
     - GetsWet(John). This means we now have four facts in our knowledge base: 
     Raining,Outside(John), ¬HasUmbrella(John), GetsWet(John).
     
     - Then R3 with ‘x = John’ matches the facts, so we can also infer 
     CatchesCold(John),and end up with five facts: the initial three, 
     GetsWet(John), CatchesCold(John)
     
     - Note that there is no way we can end up with GetsSunTan(John)

u. What will be the result of the below 3 facts?
   Sunny, Outside(John), ¬HasUmbrella(John)
ans: GetsSunBurnt(John)

v. The process of deriving new facts from given facts is called ______?
ans: Inference

w. List 3 advantages and 2 disadvantages of using Rule Based Systems for 
   Knowledge representation?
ans: Advantages
     - These systems are very expressive
     - The rules lead to a degree of modularity
     - We can easily introduce procedures for handling certainty factors, 
       and this leads to the possibility of probabilistic reasoning
     Disadvantages
     - There is a lack of precise semantics for the rules
     - The systems are not always efficient

x. So far we've only considered symbolic representation, there also exists
   ____________?
ans: non-symbolic (e.g. pictorial)

y. In selecting a representational formalism one needs to consider?
ans: - Exactly what has to be represented, and how that knowledge needs to
       be processed 
     - We should also consider how the system will go about acquiring new 
       knowledge

z. In practice, there is no single best knowledge representation system 
   that can be used for everything. true or false?

ans: Binary classification: is when the algorithm tries to label input into 
     two distinct classes 
     Muliclass classification: is selecting between more than two classes.

j. There are 7 steps involved in supervised learning. List all 7?
ans: - Step 1 : Defining problem and gathering data for it.
     - Step 2 : Pre-processing data.
     - Step 3 : Split data into train and test sets.
     - Step 4 : Training the model.
     - Step 5 : Evaluating model.
     - Step 6 : Improve model.
     - Step 7 : Deploying model and monitoring.

k. Explain unsupervised learning?
ans: In Unsupervised learning, the model is not supervised. 
     - Instead, we allow the model to work on its own to discover 
       information. 
     - It mainly deals with the unlabelled data. 
     - Unsupervised learning algorithms allow you to perform more complex 
       processing tasks compared to supervised learning.

l. Why unsupervised learning?
ans: - It finds all kind of unknown patterns in data.
     - It help you to find features which can be useful for categorization.
     - It is taken place in real time, so all the input data to be analysed 
       and labelled in the presence of learners.
     - It is easier to get unlabelled data from a computer than labelled 
       data, which needs manual intervention.

m. What are the 2 type of Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques?
ans: 1. Clustering:
       - Mainly deals with finding a structure or pattern in a collection 
         of uncategorized data. 
       - Clustering algorithms will process your data and find natural 
         clusters (groups) if they exist in the data. 
       - You can also modify how many clusters your algorithms should 
         identify. It allows you to adjust the granularity of these groups.
     2. Association: 
       - Association rules allow you to establish associations amongst data 
         objects inside large databases.
       - It is about discovering exciting relationships between variables 
         in large databases. 
       - For example, people that buy a new home most likely to buy new 
         furniture.

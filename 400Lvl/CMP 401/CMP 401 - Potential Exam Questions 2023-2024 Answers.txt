i. Computers need their own language for various reasons. Discuss any 3 of 
   these reasons
ans: 

ii. Discuss object-oriented language stating the major principle behind it
ans: Object-oriented language looks at the world as a group of objects with 
     internal data, some of which are accessible to the outside world.
     It thinks of a collection of objects and what services they can offer
     It thrives on reusability and inheritance
     The main principle here is encapsulation which refers to the coupling of the fields and methods of an object inside that object

iii. Discuss the reasons behind the idea of studying programming languages.
ans: It helps improve a programmers ability to develop effective 
     Algorithms, It improves our ability to use existing languages, learn 
     new languages, design a language, pick the right programming language 
     for solving particular problems and also it adds to our vocabulary 
     containing useful programming constructs  

iv. Who would you meet when it is time to define and standardize your 
    programming language? Why does your language need standardizing and 
    when is the appropriate time to go for it?
ans: Who would I meet?
     I would either meet one of the 3
     - ISO (International Standards Organization)
     - IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering)
     - ANSI (American National Standards Institute)

v. Discuss any 2 of the commonly used criteria for evaluating a programming 
   language
ans: 

vi. Describe any 2 of the commonly used criteria for evaluating a 
    programming language
ans: 

vii. Using an example, differentiate between the syntax and the semantics 
     of a programming language
ans: 

viii. Given the statement: int i = 2 * count + 17 * (a+b);, separate the 
      statement into its tokens and lexemes.
ans: 

ix. Given the grammar for a small language as:
<program> -> begin <stmt_list> end
              <stmt_list> -> <stmt> 
              | <stmt>; <stmt_list> 
              <stmt> -> <var>=<expression>
              <var>->A|B|C
              <expression>-><var>+<var>
              |<var>-<var>
              |<var>
ans: 

x. Generate the grammar for A=B*(A+C) and provide its parse tree.
ans: 

xi. Show that the statement: A=B+C*A is an ambiguous grammar.
ans:

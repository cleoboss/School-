 b. List all 3 categories of programming languages?
 ans: - procedural programming languages
      - functional programming languages
      - object oriented programming languages

    i. Discuss how procedural programming languages work and list 3 procedural languages?
    ans: - These are used to execute a sequence of statements
         - These languages use multiple variables and heavy loops to 
           execute their problems.
         - In procedural languages, functions may control variables other 
           than return values. For example, printing.
         - Examples of procedural languages include:
           - Basic, C/C++, Java, FORTRAN and Pascal

    ii. Discuss how functional programming languages work and list 3 functional languages?
    ans: - These languages use stored data and frequently avoid loops in 
           favour of recursive functions to execute their problems.
         - These languages focus primarily on the return values of 
           functions.
         - Functional languages are easier and allow programmers to easily 
           focus on abstract issues.
         - Examples include:
           - Python, Lisp and Erlang

    iii. Discuss how Object-oriented programming languages work and list 3 Object-oriented languages?
    ans: - These programming languages view the world as a group of objects 
           that have internal data and parts of the data can be accessed 
           externally.
         - The aim is to think about a collection of objects and services 
           that can be offered in specific problems.
         - The major principle here is encapsulation which puts everything 
           an object would need into the object.
         - These languages thrive on reusability and inheritance.
         - Examples include:
           - Java, Python, C++, Lisp, and Perl

 c. List 5 reasons why one should study programming languages?
 ans: - To improve our ability to develop effective Algorithms
      - To improve our use of your existing Programming Languages
      - To increase our vocabulary of useful programming constructs
      - To allow a better choice of programming language
      - To make it easier to learn a new language
      - To make it easier to design a new language


3a. List the 3 national standards bodies that define Language standards?
ans: IS0 - International Standards Organization
     ANSI - American National Standards Institute
     IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering 

    i. There are 4 steps this organizations take to defining Language 
       standards. Name them?
    ans: - Working group of volunteers set up to define standard
         - Agree on features for new standard
         - Vote on standard
         - If approved by working group, submitted to parent organization 
           for approval

    ii. How often are standards reviewed?
    ans: Once every 5 years

 b. why are standards important?
 ans: - Standards ensure language conformity with rules and laws.
      - Standards define behavior/constructs of language - one that
        meets the rules of language standards.

4a. How are Languages defined?
ans: They are defined on the basis of characters and symbols which are 
     strung up to form words or signs
 b.     

5a. List 4 of the commonly used criteria for Evaluating a programming 
    language?
ans: - Readability
     - Writability
     - Reliability
     - Cost 

 b. Discuss the below
    - Readability
    - Writability
    - Reliability
      i. List 4 characteristic used in measuring Reliability of programming languages

Phases of compilation using a simple example in a hypothetical programming language

# Source Program
def calculate_square(x):
    result = x * x
    return result

# Main Program
number = 5
square_result = calculate_square(number)
print("The square of", number, "is", square_result)


Now, let's go through each phase of compilation:

1. Source Program:
  This is the original code written by the programmer.

2. Lexical Analyzer:
  The lexical analyzer scans the source code and breaks it into tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of the code, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
 Example tokens:

  def, calculate_square, (, x, ), :, return, 5, *, print, "The square of", ,, number, ,, "is", ,, square_result, ,, 5, ,, calculate_square, (, number, ), :

3. Syntax Analyzer:
  The syntax analyzer (parser) checks the arrangement of tokens to ensure they form a valid syntax tree according to the language's grammar rules.

4. Intermediate Code Generator:
  The intermediate code generator translates the syntax tree into an intermediate representation. In this simplified example, let's consider a three-address code as the intermediate code.
Example three-address code:

t1 = x * x
result = t1
return result
number = 5
t2 = calculate_square(number)
square_result = t2
print("The square of", number, "is", square_result)

5. Semantic Analyzer:
  The semantic analyzer performs checks to ensure that the code has a meaningful interpretation. It checks for semantic errors that may not be captured by the syntax analysis.

6. Symbol Table:
  The symbol table keeps track of information about variables, functions, and their scopes. It stores details like variable types, memory locations, and function signatures.

Example symbol table entries:

calculate_square: function
x: parameter
result: variable
number: variable
square_result: variable

7. Optimization:
  The optimization phase aims to improve the efficiency of the code. It may include various transformations to reduce execution time or memory usage.

8. Code Generator:
  The code generator translates the intermediate code into machine code or another low-level representation that can be executed by the computer. In this hypothetical case, let's consider generating simple assembly code.

Example assembly code:

; Assembly code (hypothetical)
MOV  R1, number
MUL  R1, R1     ; Calculate square
MOV  square_result, R1


Computer Execution:
  The generated code is executed on the target computer.

N.B-> Keep in mind that this example is quite simplified, and real-world compilers involve additional complexities and optimizations. The described phases provide a general overview of the compilation process.
